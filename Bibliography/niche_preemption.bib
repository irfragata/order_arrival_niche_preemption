abstract = {Summary: Plants respond to herbivory by mounting a defense. Some plant-eating spider mites (Tetranychus spp.) have adapted to plant defenses to maintain a high reproductive performance. From natural populations we selected three spider mite strains from two species, Tetranychus urticae and Tetranychus evansi, that can suppress plant defenses, using a fourth defense-inducing strain as a benchmark, to assess to which extent these strains suppress defenses differently. We characterized timing and magnitude of phytohormone accumulation and defense-gene expression, and determined if mites that cannot suppress defenses benefit from sharing a leaf with suppressors. The nonsuppressor strain induced a mixture of jasmonate- (JA) and salicylate (SA)-dependent defenses. Induced defense genes separated into three groups: 'early' (expression peak at 1 d postinfestation (dpi)); 'intermediate' (4 dpi); and 'late', whose expression increased until the leaf died. The T. evansi strains suppressed genes from all three groups, but the T. urticae strain only suppressed the late ones. Suppression occurred downstream of JA and SA accumulation, independently of the JA-SA antagonism, and was powerful enough to boost the reproductive performance of nonsuppressors up to 45%. Our results show that suppressing defenses not only brings benefits but, within herbivore communities, can also generate a considerable ecological cost when promoting the population growth of a competitor.},

abstract = {While many ecological theories have historically invoked niche differences as the primary mechanism allowing species coexistence, we now know that coexistence in competitive communities depends on the balance of two opposing forces: niche differences (ND) that determine how species limit their own growth rate versus that of their competitor, and relative fitness differences (RFD) that establish competitive hierarchies among species. Several different empirical methods have been proposed for quantifying ND and RFD in order to make predictions about coexistence between pairs of species, yet it remains unclear which method(s) are appropriate for a given empirical study and whether or not those methods yield the same information. Here we compare six different empirical methods and provide a practical guide to help empiricists determine which method(s) are best for their study system. We show that there are important tradeoffs between mechanistic methods, which require detailed understanding of species' resource use and physiology but are more tractable experimentally, and phenomenological methods which do not require this detailed information but can be impractical for some study designs. Finally, we show that the methods do not always yield the same values and therefore we caution against future syntheses that compile these estimates from different empirical studies.},

abstract = {Studying distribution is necessary to understand and manage the dynamics of species with spatially structured populations. Here we studied the distribution in Tetranychus evansi and T. urticae, two mite pests of tomato, in the scope of evaluating factors that can influence the effectiveness of Integrated Pest Management strategies. We found greater positive densitydependent distribution with T. evansi than T. urticae when assayed on single, detached tomato leaves. Indeed, T. evansi distribution among leaflets increased with initial population density while it was high even at low T. urticae densities. Intensity and rate of damage to whole plants was higher with T. evansi than T. urticae. We further studied the circadian migration of T. evansi within plant. When T. evansi density was high the distribution behavior peaked between 8 am and 3 pm and between 8 pm and 3 am local time of Kenya. Over 24 h the total number of mites ascending and descending was always similar and close to the total population size. The gregarious behavior of T. evansi combined with its rapid population growth rate, may explain why few tomato plants can be severely damaged by T. evansi and how suddenly all the crop can be highly infested. However the localisation and elimination of the first infested plants damaged by T. evansi could reduce the risk of outbreaks in the entire crop. These findings suggest also that an acaricide treated net placed on the first infested plants could be very effective to control T. evansi. Moreover circadian migration would therefore accentuate the efficiency of an acaricide treated net covering the infested plants. Copyright: {\textcopyright} 2014 Reekie et al.},

Components of host plant quality (such as carbon, nitrogen, and defensive metabolites) directly affect potential and achieved herbivore fecundity. The responses of insect herbivores to changes in host plant quality vary within and between feeding guilds. Host plant quality also affects insect reproductive strategies: Egg size and quality, the allocation of resources to eggs, and the choice of oviposition sites may all be influenced by plant quality, as may egg or embryo resorption on poor-quality hosts. Many insect herbivores change the quality of their host plants, affecting both inter- and intraspecific interactions. Higher - trophic level interactions, such as the performance of predators and parasitoids, may also be affected by host plant quality. We conclude that host plant quality affects the fecundity of herbivorous insects at both the individual and the population scale.},

abstract = {Elucidating elementary mechanisms that underlie bacterial diversity is central to ecology1,2 and microbiome research3. Bacteria are known to coexist by metabolic specialization4, cooperation5 and cyclic warfare6–8. Many species are also motile9, which is studied in terms of mechanism10,11, benefit12,13, strategy14,15, evolution16,17 and ecology18,19. Indeed, bacteria often compete for nutrient patches that become available periodically or by random disturbances2,20,21. However, the role of bacterial motility in coexistence remains unexplored experimentally. Here we show that—for mixed bacterial populations that colonize nutrient patches—either population outcompetes the other when low in relative abundance. This inversion of the competitive hierarchy is caused by active segregation and spatial exclusion within the patch: a small fast-moving population can outcompete a large fast-growing population by impeding its migration into the patch, while a small fast-growing population can outcompete a large fast-moving population by expelling it from the initial contact area. The resulting spatial segregation is lost for weak growth–migration trade-offs and a lack of virgin space, but is robust to population ratio, density and chemotactic ability, and is observed in both laboratory and wild strains. These findings show that motility differences and their trade-offs with growth are sufficient to promote diversity, and suggest previously undescribed roles for motility in niche formation and collective expulsion–containment strategies beyond individual search and survival.},

abstract = {Plants are often attacked by multiple antagonists, and traits of the attacking organisms, and their order of arrival onto hosts, may affect plant defenses. However, few studies have assessed how multiple antagonists, and varying attack order, affect plant defense or nutrition. To address this, we assessed defensive and nutritional responses of Pisum sativum plants after attack by a vector herbivore (Acrythosiphon pisum), a non-vector herbivore (Sitona lineatus), and a pathogen (Pea enation mosaic virus, PEMV). We show PEMV-infectious A. pisum induced several pathogen-specific plant defense signals, but these defenses were inhibited when S. lineatus was present in peas infected with PEMV. Sitona lineatus also increased abundance of plant amino acids, but only when they attacked after PEMV-infectious A. pisum. Feeding by S. lineatus also promoted expression of several anti-herbivore defenses, but these defenses were inhibited when PEMV was also present. Our results suggest that diverse communities of biotic antagonists alter defense and nutritional traits of plants through complex pathways that depend on the identity of attackers and their order of arrival onto hosts. Moreover, simply examining the jasmonic and salicylic acid pathways may fail to reveal more complex pathways by which plants respond to biotic stress.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Investigations of plant-herbivore interactions continue to be popular; however, a bias neglecting root feeders may limit our ability to understand how herbivores shape plant life histories. Root feeders can cause dramatic plant population declines, often associated with secondary stress factors such as drought or grazing. These severe impacts resulted in substantial interest in root feeders as agricultural pests and increasingly as biological weed control agents, particularly in North America. Despite logistical difficulties, establishment rates in biocontrol programs are equal or exceed those of aboveground herbivores (67.2% for aboveground herbivores, 77.5% for belowground herbivores) and root feeders are more likely to contribute to control (53.7% versus 33.6%). Models predicting root feeders would be negatively affected by competitively superior aboveground herbivores may be limited to early successional habitats or generalist root feeders attacking annual plants. In later successional habitats, root feeders become more abundant and appear to be the more potent force in driving plant performance and plant community composition. Aboveground herbivores, even at high population levels, were unable to prevent buildup of root herbivore populations and the resulting population collapse of their host plants. Significant information gaps exist about the impact of root feeders on plant physiology and secondary chemistry and their importance in natural areas, particularly in the tropics.},

abstract = {Plants have evolved numerous defensive traits that enable them to resist herbivores. In turn, this resistance has selected for herbivores that can cope with defenses by either avoiding, resisting or suppressing them. Several species of herbivorous mites, such as the spider mites Tetranychus urticae and Tetranychus evansi, were found to maximize their performance by suppressing inducible plant defenses. At first glimpse it seems obvious why such a trait will be favored by natural selection. However, defense suppression appeared to readily backfire since mites that do so also make their host plant more suitable for competitors and their offspring more attractive for natural enemies. This, together with the fact that spider mites are infamous for their ability to resist (plant) toxins directly, justifies the question as to why traits that allow mites to suppress defenses nonetheless seem to be relatively common? We argue that this trait may facilitate generalist herbivores, like T. urticae, to colonize new host species. While specific detoxification mechanisms may, on average, be suitable only on a narrow range of similar hosts, defense suppression may be more broadly effective, provided it operates by targeting conserved plant signaling components. If so, resistance and suppression may be under frequency-dependent selection and be maintained as a polymorphism in generalist mite populations. In that case, the defense suppression trait may be under rapid positive selection in subpopulations that have recently colonized a new host but may erode in relatively isolated populations in which host-specific detoxification mechanisms emerge. Although there is empirical evidence to support these scenarios, it contradicts the observation that several of the mite species found to suppress plant defenses actually are relatively specialized. We argue that in these cases buffering traits may enable such mites to mitigate the negative side effects of suppression in natural communities and thus shield this trait from natural selection.},

abstract = {The study of species co-occurrences has been central in community ecology since the foundation of the discipline. Co-occurrence data are, nevertheless, a neglected source of information to model species distributions and biogeographers are still debating about the impact of biotic interactions on species distributions across geographical scales. We argue that a theory of species co-occurrence in ecological networks is needed to better inform interpretation of co-occurrence data, to formulate hypotheses for different community assembly mechanisms, and to extend the analysis of species distributions currently focused on the relationship between occurrences and abiotic factors. The main objective of this paper is to provide the first building blocks of a general theory for species co-occurrences. We formalize the problem with definitions of the different probabilities that are studied in the context of co-occurrence analyses. We analyze three species interactions modules and conduct multi-species simulations in order to document five principles influencing the associations between species within an ecological network: (i) direct interactions impact pairwise co-occurrence, (ii) indirect interactions impact pairwise co-occurrence, (iii) pairwise co-occurrence rarely are symmetric, (iv) the strength of an association decreases with the length of the shortest path between two species, and (v) the strength of an association decreases with the number of interactions a species is experiencing. Our analyses reveal the difficulty of the interpretation of species interactions from co-occurrence data. We discuss whether the inference of the structure of interaction networks is feasible from co-occurrence data. We also argue that species distributions models could benefit from incorporating conditional probabilities of interactions within the models as an attempt to take into account the contribution of biotic interactions to shaping individual distributions of species.},

abstract = {The spider mite Tetranychus evansi is an emerging pest of solanaceous crops worldwide. Like many other emerging pests, its small size, confusing taxonomy, complex history of associations with humans, and propensity to start new populations from small inocula, make the study of its invasion biology difficult. Here, we use recent developments in Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and variation in multi-locus genetic markers to reconstruct the complex historical demography of this cryptic invasive pest. By distinguishing among multiple pathways and timing of introductions, we find evidence for the "bridgehead effect", in which one invasion serves as source for subsequent invasions. Tetranychus evansi populations in Europe and Africa resulted from at least three independent introductions from South America and involved mites from two distinct sources in Brazil, corresponding to highly divergent mitochondrial DNA lineages. Mites from southwest Brazil (BR-SW) colonized the African continent, and from there Europe through two pathways in a "bridgehead" type pattern. One pathway resulted in a widespread invasion, not only to Europe, but also to other regions in Africa, southern Europe and eastern Asia. The second pathway involved the mixture with a second introduction from BR-SW leading to an admixed population in southern Spain. Admixture was also detected between invasive populations in Portugal. A third introduction from the Brazilian Atlantic region resulted in only a limited invasion in Europe. This study illustrates that ABC methods can provide insights into, and distinguish among, complex invasion scenarios. These processes are critical not only in understanding the biology of invasions, but also in refining management strategies for invasive species. For example, while reported observations of the mite and outbreaks in the invaded areas were largely consistent with estimates of geographical expansion from the ABC approach, historical observations failed to recognize the complex pathways involved and the corresponding effects on genetic diversity. {\textcopyright} 2012 Boubou et al.},

abstract = {Among the herbivorous arthropods that feed on strawberry, the most important are the two-spotted spider mite (TSSM), Tetranychus urticae Koch, and several species of aphids. Mites and aphids belong to different guilds that coexist in the field and feed on the undersides of strawberry leaflets. However, the occurrence of large numbers of individuals of both species on the same leaflet is rarely recorded. We hypothesize that negative interactions between TSSM and aphids explain the intraplant distribution of these herbivores. We first examined the spatial coincidence of both herbivores in the field. Under experimental conditions, we then analyzed: (i) the rate of increase of TSSM and the aphid Chaetosiphon fragaefolii (Cockerell), growing individually and together; (ii) the effect of honeydew on TSSM preference; and (iii) the effect of previous strawberry leaflet damage by TSSM on C. fragaefolii preference. The proportion of TSSM that coincided with at least one aphid decreased as the percentage of leaflets with TSSM increased. The spatial coincidence index between aphids and TSSM increased together with the percentage of TSSM-infested leaflets. TSSM showed both a lower rate of increase when they shared the same leaflet with C. fragaefolii and lower fecundity on strawberry discs with honeydew. The rate of increase of C. fragaefolii did not change on co-occupied leaves, but the aphid species moved to the other side of leaflets shared with TSSM. Negative interactions resulting in a tendency for species to avoid each other, such as demonstrated herein, can affect distribution and performance of herbivorous arthropods.

abstract = {Coinfection of host populations alters pathogen prevalence, host mortality, and pathogen evolution. Because pathogens compete for limiting resources, whether multiple pathogens can coexist in a host population can depend on their within-host interactions, which, in turn, can depend on the order in which pathogens infect hosts (within-host priority effects). However, the consequences of within-host priority effects for pathogen coexistence have not been tested. Using laboratory studies with a coinfected zooplankton system, we found that pathogens had increased fitness in coinfected hosts when they were the second pathogen to infect a host, compared to when they were the first pathogen to infect a host. With these results, we parameterized a pathogen coexistence model with priority effects, finding that pathogen coexistence (1) decreased when priority effects increased the fitness of the first pathogen to arrive in coinfected hosts and (2) increased when priority effects increased the fitness of the second pathogen to arrive in coinfected hosts. We also identified the natural conditions under which we expect within-host priority effects to foster coexistence in our system. These outcomes were the result of positive or negative frequency dependence created by feedback loops between pathogen prevalence and infection order in coinfected hosts. This suggests that priority effects can systematically alter conditions for pathogen coexistence in host populations, thereby changing pathogen community structure and potentially altering host mortality and pathogen evolution via emergent processes.},

abstract = {The focus of most ideas on diversity maintenance is species coexistence, which may be stable or unstable. Stable coexistence can be quantified by the long-term rates at which community members recover from low density. Quantification shows that coexistence mechanisms function in two major ways: They may be (a) equalizing because they tend to minimize average fitness differences between species, or (b) stabilizing because they tend to increase negative intraspecific interactions relative to negative interspecific interactions. Stabilizing mechanisms are essential for species coexistence and include traditional mechanisms such as resource partitioning and frequency-dependent predation, as well as mechanisms that depend on fluctuations in population densities and environmental factors in space and time. Equalizing mechanisms contribute to stable coexistence because they reduce large average fitness inequalities which might negate the effects of stabilizing mechanisms. Models of unstable coexitence, in which species diversity slowly decays overtime, have focused almost exclusively on equalizing mechanisms. These models would be more robust if they also included stabilizing mechanisms, which arise in many and varied ways but need not be adequate for full stability of a system. Models of unstable coexistence invite a broader view of diversity maintenance incorporating species turnover.},

abstract = {Organisms are frequently coinfected by multiple parasite strains and species, and interactions between parasites within hosts are known to influence parasite prevalence and diversity, as well as epidemic timing. Importantly, interactions between coinfecting parasites can be affected by the order in which they infect hosts (i.e. within-host priority effects). In this study, we use a single-host, two-pathogen, SI model with environmental transmission to explore how within-host priority effects scale up to alter host population-scale infection patterns. Specifically, we ask how parasite prevalence changes in the presence of different types of priority effects. We consider two scenarios without priority effects and four scenarios with priority effects where there is either an advantage or a disadvantage to being the first to infect in a coinfected host. Models without priority effects always predict negative relationships between the prevalences of both parasites. In contrast, models with priority effects can yield unimodal prevalence relationships where the prevalence of a focal parasite is minimized or maximized at intermediate prevalences of a coinfecting parasite. The mechanism behind this pattern is that as the prevalence of the coinfecting parasite increases, most infections of the focal parasite change from occurring as solo infections, to first arrival coinfections, to second arrival coinfections. The corresponding changes in parasite fitness as the focal parasite moves from one infection class to another then map to changes in focal parasite prevalence. Further, we found that even when parasites interact negatively within a host, they still can have positive prevalence relationships at the population scale. These results suggest that within-host priority effects can change host population-scale infection patterns in systematic (and initially counterintuitive) ways, and that taking them into account may improve disease forecasting in coinfected populations.},

abstract = {Co-infections of hosts by multiple pathogen species are ubiquitous, but predicting their impact on disease remains challenging. Interactions between co-infecting pathogens within hosts can alter pathogen transmission, with the impact on transmission typically dependent on the relative arrival order of pathogens within hosts (within-host priority effects). However, it is unclear how these within-host priority effects influence multi-pathogen epidemics, particularly when the arrival order of pathogens at the host-population scale varies. Here, we combined models and experiments with zooplankton and their naturally co-occurring fungal and bacterial pathogens to examine how within-host priority effects influence multi-pathogen epidemics. Epidemiological models parametrized with within-host priority effects measured at the single-host scale predicted that advancing the start date of bacterial epidemics relative to fungal epidemics would decrease the mean bacterial prevalence in a multi-pathogen setting, while models without within-host priority effects predicted the opposite effect. We tested these predictions with experimental multi-pathogen epidemics. Empirical dynamics matched predictions from the model including within-host priority effects, providing evidence that within-host priority effects influenced epidemic dynamics. Overall, within-host priority effects may be a key element of predicting multi-pathogen epidemic dynamics in the future, particularly as shifting disease phenology alters the order of infection within hosts.},

abstract = {Questions related to understanding which characteristics of the recipient communities make them vulnerable to invasion (i.e. invasibility) are commonly formulated in such a way that they consider ecological communities as whole entities. Yet, species within recipient communities have specific responses to the introduction of exotic species. As a consequence, little is known about the role of species interaction networks within and between trophic levels in determining the invasion likelihood of exotics introduced in previously uninvaded communities and the temporal dynamics of invaded communities. To obtain a mature understanding of invasion processes and their impacts, I propose here to apply a structural stability approach of species coexistence to the field of biological invasions. The main aim here is to distinguish how direct and indirect species' responses to invasion in competitive and trophic networks translate to the mechanisms determining the maintenance and stability of species diversity in multispecies and multitrophic assemblages. This approach brings the further opportunity to integrate the field of biological invasions within a broader perspective about the study of novel ecosystems, that is, ecosystems that contain exotic species and face new introductions sometimes under abrupt environmental changes. Moreover, it can help to target specific mechanisms separating winners from losers in novel ecosystems. Synthesis. A solid framework to predict biological invasions and understand community assembly along temporal scales under novel ecosystems can be obtained by framing species' responses to invasion within recent theoretical and methodological advances stemming from coexistence theory, which seeks to determine how diversity is maintained.

abstract = {Current theories on plant-herbivore interactions suggest that plant species of different successional status and leaves of various ages differ in their degree of ephemerality and predictability to herbivores, and will therefore exhibit different anti-herbivore characteristics1-6. Old leaves and leaves of mature forest plants are expected to be better defended than ephemeral young leaves and leaves of early successional plants. These predicted patterns of plant defence and the resultant patterns of insect grazing are not well documented for natural communities. Field studies have shown that mammalian herbivores in a tropical forest prefer young leaves7 and that insect grazing in a temperate forest is heaviest on the young leaves8. Laboratory studies have shown that late successional species9,12 or plants with certain chemical defences13-17 are less palatable for generalist herbivores. Laboratory results depend, however, on the particular herbivore tested, and may not accurately predict rates of herbivory in natural systems. Here I report on rates of herbivory on young and mature leaves from tree species with different life history patterns. Grazing rates (% leaf area eaten per day) on mature leaves of fast growing, shade-intolerant species (pioneers) were an order of magnitude greater than those on slow growing, shade-tolerant species (persistents). Young leaves in both groups of species suffered significantly greater grazing damage than mature leaves. {\textcopyright} 1980 Nature Publishing Group.},

Here we used a spatially explicit, fine-scale grid-based model that simulated diffusion and plant uptake of nutrients by plants in soil to test whether concentration reduction theory was appropriate for terrestrial plant competition for nutrients. In the absence of competition, increasing the rate of diffusion allows a plant to maintain positive growth rates below the lowest average concentration to which it can reduce nutrients in soil solution (R*). As such, differences among plants in the reduction of soil moisture, which here primarily affects nutrient diffusion, can cause R* to predict competitive success incorrectly. The stronger competitor for nutrients captures the largest proportion of the nutrient supply by ensuring nutrients contact its roots before those of a competitor. Although the metric derived from concentration reduction theory, R*, might have predictive power for competitive outcomes in terrestrial ecosystems, this evidence suggests that plants outcompete other plants for nutrients by pre-empting the supply, not reducing the average concentration. {\textcopyright} New Phytologist (2005).},

abstract = {Priority effects, in which the order of species arrival dictates community assembly, can have a major influence on species diversity, but the genetic basis of priority effects remains unknown. Here, we suggest that nitrogen scavenging genes previously considered responsible for starvation avoidance may drive priority effects by causing rapid resource depletion. Using single-molecule sequencing, we de novo assembled the genome of the nectarcolonizing yeast, Metschnikowia reukaufii, across eight scaffolds and complete mitochondrion, with gap-free coverage over gene spaces. We found a high rate of tandem gene duplication in this genome, enriched for nitrogen metabolism and transport. Both high-capacity amino acid importers, GAP1 and PUT4, present as tandem gene arrays, were highly expressed in synthetic nectar and regulated by the availability and quality of amino acids. In experiments with competitive nectar yeast, Candida rancensis, amino acid addition alleviated suppression of C. rancensis by early arrival of M. reukaufii, corroborating that amino acid scavenging may contribute to priority effects. Because niche pre-emption via rapid resource depletion may underlie priority effects in a broad range of microbial, plant and animal communities, nutrient scavenging genes like the ones we considered here may be broadly relevant to understanding priority effects.},

In the present study we examined the ecological impact of its arrival in the Mediterranean region. The spider mite and phytoseiid mite assemblages in various crop and non-crop plants in three areas of Valencia (Spain) were studied a few months before and 10 years after the invasion of T. evansi. According to rarefaction analyses, the invasion of T. evansi did not affect neither the total number of species in the mite community examined (spider mite and phytoseiid species) nor the number of species when the two communities were examined separately. However, after the invasion, the absolute and relative abundance of the native Tetranychus species was significantly reduced. Before the invasion, T. urticae and T. turkestani were the most abundant spider mites, accounting for 62.9 and 22.8 % of the specimens. After the invasion, T. evansi became the most abundant species, representing 60 % of the total spider mites recorded, whereas the abundance of T. urticae was significantly reduced (23 %). This reduction took place principally on non-crop plants, where native species were replaced by the invader. Null model analyses provided evidence for competition structuring the spider mite community on non-crop plants after the invasion of T. evansi. Resistance to acaricides, the absence of efficient native natural enemies, manipulation of the plant defenses and the web type produced by T. evansi are discussed as possible causes for the competitive displacement. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Very little is known about how variation in environmental conditions alters the strength and the structure of competitive networks and what are the consequences of this for species coexistence. We performed a competition experiment with 10 annual plant species to parameterise a population model describing species' dynamics according to their vital rates and pairwise competitive coefficients. Seeds from all species were sown under two different climatic scenarios: (1) right before the first major storm of the growing season and (2) after an imposed fall drought of 2 months simulating an extreme climatic event of intense aridity. Species' demography and competitive responses were used to estimate pairwise stabilising niche differences and average fitness differences. In addition, we used tools from network theory to characterise the structure of multispecies competition from the determinants of species coexistence. Specifically, we evaluated changes in competitive dominance between species pairs, and the prevalence of intransitive competitive relationships for 120 triplets between these two climatic events. The experimental extreme event significantly reduced fitness differences between species pairs. Such an equalising mechanism promotes coexistence. However, niche differences were also reduced in such a way that the number of species pairs whose niche differences overcame their fitness differences was reduced from six to two. Contrary to our expectations, the extreme event did not increase the hierarchy of competitive dominance. Instead, and depending on the technique used, the prevalence of intransitivity remained marginally similar (17% to 22%) or significantly increased from 19.4% to 29.8%. This pattern was likely a consequence of the significant changes in competitive dominance between species pairs (26 changes out of 45; 58%). Although fitness differences were equalised and intransitive competition promoted, our model predicted a lower likelihood of coexistence under the extreme event for both species pairs and triplets, mainly because competitive interactions did not promote enough niche differences to balance the observed fitness asymmetries in our competitive networks. Synthesis. We empirically proved that an extreme climate results in communities with reduced niche and fitness differences in which species are less likely to coexist despite the increasing prevalence of intransitive competition.},

How much of the coexistence observed in species-rich communities results from indirect effects among competitors that only emerge in diverse systems remains poorly understood. Resolving this issue requires simple, scalable, and intuitive metrics for quantifying the conditions for coexistence in multispecies systems, and how these conditions differ from those expected based solely on pairwise interactions. To achieve these aims, we develop a structural approach for studying the set of parameter values compatible with n-species coexistence given the geometric constraints imposed by the matrix of competition coefficients. We derive novel mathematical metrics analogous to stabilizing niche differences and fitness differences that measure the range of conditions compatible with multispecies coexistence, incorporating the effects of indirect interactions emerging in diverse systems. We show how our measures can be used to quantify the extent to which the conditions for coexistence in multispecies systems differ from those that allow pairwise coexistence, and apply the method to a field system of annual plants. We conclude by presenting new challenges and empirical opportunities emerging from our structural metrics of multispecies coexistence.},

abstract = {A general model of competitive and apparent competitive interactions in a spatially-variable environment is developed and analyzed to extend findings on coexistence in a temporally-variable environment to the spatial case and to elucidate new principles. In particular, coexistence mechanisms are divided into variation-dependent and variation-independent mechanisms with variation-dependent mechanisms including spatial generalizations of relative nonlinearity and the storage effect. Although directly analogous to the corresponding temporal mechanisms, these spatial mechanisms involve different life history traits which suggest that the spatial storage effect should arise more commonly than the temporal storage effect and spatial relative nonlinearity should arise less commonly than temporal relative nonlinearity. Additional mechanisms occur in the spatial case due to spatial covariance between the finite rate of increase of a local population and its local abundance, which has no clear temporal analogue. A limited analysis of these additional mechanisms shows that they have similar properties to the storage effect and relative nonlinearity and potentially may be considered as enlargements of the earlier mechanisms. The rate of increase of a species perturbed to low density is used to quantify coexistence. A general quadratic approximation, which is exact in some important cases, divides this rate of increase into contributions from the various mechanisms above and admits no other mechanisms, suggesting that opportunities for coexistence in a spatially-variable environment are fully characterized by these mechanisms within this general model. Three spatially-implicit models are analyzed as illustrations of the general findings and of techniques using small variance approximations. The contributions to coexistence of the various mechanisms are expressed in terms of simple interpretable formulae. These spatially-implicit models include a model of an annual plant community, a spatial multispecies version of the lottery model, and a multispecies model of an insect community competing for spatially-patchy and ephemeral food. {\textcopyright} 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Many anthropic activities generate soil disturbances, favoring competitive, fast growing invasive plant species at the expense of natives. Active restoration of invasion-resistant plant communities is increasingly recognized as a relevant strategy to combat invasive plant colonization in disturbed areas, but results are often unsatisfying. Historical effects, referred as “priority effects” (i.e. the effects generated by the order in which species arrive at a local site), can have a major role in community assembly and invasion success because they involve early colonists altering the performance of later colonists. Taking these priority effects into account in restoration projects is emerging as a relevant way to improve native species restoration success and prevent invasion. The present review discusses two strategies considering priority effects that would help to achieve the classic restoration goal of “more natives, less invasives”. The first strategy relies on tackling priority effects of invasive plants using different management options adapted to local environmental conditions, including removal, reduction of propagule sources, or mitigation of soil legacies. Indeed, invasive plants often generate strong priority effects providing themselves a substantial competitive advantage through early emergence and quick growth, but also self-induced soil modifications that can persist after their removal or death, commonly termed “soil legacies”. In fertile and stable conditions, the reduction of invasive species priority effects must be coupled with the restoration of an invasion-resistant native plant cover to avoid reinvasion and secondary invasions. The second strategy is to bring about situations in which the restored native species are more likely to exert strong priority effects, decreasing invasion success. For this purpose, we sketch possible options open to restorationists based on resource or non-resource mechanisms. First, we discuss ways to maximize resource preemption by extending the time advance given to restored native species and manipulating restored species characteristics. Second, we consider the potential effect of increasing niche overlap between native and invasive species. Third, we introduce the potential manipulations of non-resource mechanisms, such as allelopathy, herbivory, disease, or the presence of mycorrhizae, to increase priority effects. This review incorporates recent research on priority effects to draw the outlines of priority effects-based restoration strategies and define future research questions that need to be addressed to test and improve these strategies.},

abstract = {Mounting evidence suggests that the history of species arrival to a locality can have important effects on species performance but the mechanism(s) through which priority effects are produced is not always clear. Differences in the developmental time of frog tadpoles provide an opportunity to examine mechanisms through which priority effects may influence fitness components of a late arriving taxon. Specifically, tadpoles of the southern leopard frog (Rana) can often require more than a year to complete metamorphosis so they overwinter in a pond and compete with newly deposited tadpoles in the spring. We conducted an experiment in artificial ponds to evaluate mechanisms through which overwintering Rana tadpoles influence fitness components of southern toad (Bufo) tadpoles deposited into ponds during the spring. We found that overwintered Rana reduced Bufo performance while newly hatched Rana that enter a pond simultaneously with Bufo did not. The production of this priority effect was primarily the result of Rana depleting algal resources in a pond during the winter prior to Bufo arrival. The performance of Bufo did not correspond with variation in the abundance of algae present in a pond during the spring and we found evidence to indicate that, in the absence of resource exploitation during the winter, overwintered Rana do not compete strongly with Bufo during the spring when both species co-occur. When Rana deplete algal resources during the winter, however, interactions between Rana and Bufo during the spring became much more important as both the development rate and survival of Bufo was reduced to a greater extent than what would have been predicted by resource exploitation alone. Our results demonstrate that priority effects can result from early colonists depleting resource availability prior to the arrival of other species which can intensify behavioral/physical interactions between species when they co-occur. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Flour beetles are a classic model system for studying competitive dynamics between species occupying the same ecological niche. Competitive performance is often interpreted in terms of biological species traits such as fecundity, resource use, and predation. However, many studies only measure competitive ability when species enter an environment simultaneously, and thus do not consider how the relative timing of species' arrival may determine competitive outcome (i.e., priority effects). Whether priority effects may influence competition in Tribolium remains to be tested. The present study examined the importance of priority effects in competitions between two common species of flour beetle (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae): Tribolium castaneum and T. confusum. To investigate whether priority effects confer competitive advantages to Tribolium beetles, relative introduction times of T. castaneum and T. confusum to competitive arenas were manipulated, and adult populations were measured for seven months. Four important patterns were noted: (1) Tribolium species given two-weeks priority access to experimental arenas attained larger populations than their latearriving competitor, (2) when founding adults were introduced simultaneously, T. castaneum was competitively dominant, (3) T. castaneum benefited more from priority arrival than T. confusum, and (4) available bran resources largely predicted population decline in adult beetles toward the end of the experiment. These results suggest competitive outcome in Tribolium is not always predicted by species' identity, and that performance could instead be determined by the timing of species' arrivals and available resources.},

abstract = {The order and timing of species immigration during community assembly can affect species abundances at multiple spatial scales. Known as priority effects, these effects cause historical contingency in the structure and function of communities, resulting in alternative stable states, alternative transient states, or compositional cycles. The mechanisms of priority effects fall into two categories, niche preemption and niche modification, and the conditions for historical contingency by priority effects can be organized into two groups, those regarding regional species pool properties and those regarding local population dynamics. Specifically, two requirements must be satisfied for historical contingency to occur: The regional pool contains species that can together cause priority effects, and local dynamics are rapid enough for early-arriving species to preempt or modify niches before other species arrive. Organizing current knowledge this way reveals an outstanding key question: How are regional species pools that yield priority effects generated and maintained?},

abstract = {Herbivore communities are shaped by indirect plant-mediated interactions whose outcomes are strongly dependent on the sequence of herbivore arrival. However, the mechanisms underlying sequence specificity are poorly understood. We examined the mechanisms that govern sequence-specific effects of the interaction between two specialist maize herbivores, the leaf feeder Spodoptera frugiperda and the root feeder Diabrotica virgifera virgifera. In the field, S. frugiperda reduces D. v. virgifera abundance, but only when it arrives on the plant first. In behavioral experiments, D. v. virgifera larvae continued feeding on plants that they had infested before leaf infestation, but refused to initiate feeding on plants that were infested by S. frugiperda before their arrival. Changes in root-emitted volatiles were sufficient to elicit this sequence-specific behavior. Root volatile and headspace mixing experiments showed that early-arriving D. v. virgifera larvae suppressed S. frugiperda-induced volatile repellents, which led to the maintenance of host attractiveness to D. v. virgifera. Our study provides a physiological and behavioral mechanism for sequence specificity in plant-mediated interactions and suggests that physiological canalization of behaviorally active metabolites can drive sequence specificity and result in strongly diverging herbivore distribution patterns.},

abstract = {Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1)Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species', ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental, work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.},

abstract = {In birch, Betula pubescens, herbivore-induced delayed induced resistance (DIR) of defoliated trees may cause a strong reduction in the potential fecundity of a geometrid folivore Epirrita autumnata. In this study, we examined the biochemical basis of DIR in birch leaves during a natural outbreak of E. autumnata. A set of experimental trees was defoliated at four sites by wild larvae in the peak year of the outbreak, whereas control trees were protected from defoliation by spraying with an insecticide. The biochemical composition of leaves was analysed in the following year and, although the DIR response was weak during this outbreak, causing less than a 20% reduction in the potential fecundity of E. autumnata, some consistent relationships between defoliation, biochemistry and pupal mass of E. autumnata suggested a general biochemical basis for the defoliation-induced responses in birch leaves. Total concentrations of nitrogen, sugars and acetone-insoluble residue (e.g. cell wall polysaccharides, cell-wall-bound phenolics, protein, starch, lignin and hemicellulose) were consistently lower, and total concentrations of phenolics, especially of gallotannins and soluble proanthocyanidins, were higher in the leaves of trees defoliated in the previous year than in those protected from defoliation. The capacity of tannins to precipitate proteins correlated with contents of gallotannins, and was highest in defoliated trees. The pupal mass of E. autumnata showed a strong, positive correlation with concentrations of nitrogen and sugars, and a negative correlation with the acetone-insoluble residue and gallotannins in foliage. Correlations with other measured biochemical traits were weak. The correlation coefficients between biochemical traits and pupal mass consistently had similar signs for both defoliated and insecticide-sprayed trees, suggesting that variation in leaf quality due to defoliation in the previous year was based on similar biochemical traits as variation for other reasons. We suggest that DIR is associated with reduced growth activity of leaves, and may be seen as a delay in the biochemical maturation of leaves in defoliated trees. This explains the high concentration of gallotannins in defoliated trees, a characteristic feature of young leaves. However, the lower content of nitrogen and the higher content of soluble proanthocyanidins in defoliated trees are traits usually characterising mature, not young, leaves, indicating defoliation-induced changes in chemistry in addition to modified leaf age. Our results emphasise the importance of understanding the natural changes in chemistry during leaf maturation when interpreting defoliation-induced changes in leaf biochemistry.},

abstract = {Background Plants are hotbeds for parasites such as arthropod herbivores, which acquire nutrients and energy from their hosts in order to grow and reproduce. Hence plants are selected to evolve resistance, which in turn selects for herbivores that can cope with this resistance. To preserve their fitness when attacked by herbivores, plants can employ complex strategies that include reallocation of resources and the production of defensive metabolites and structures. Plant defences can be either prefabricated or be produced only upon attack. Those that are ready-made are referred to as constitutive defences. Some constitutive defences are operational at any time while others require activation. Defences produced only when herbivores are present are referred to as induced defences. These can be established via de novo biosynthesis of defensive substances or via modifications of prefabricated substances and consequently these are active only when needed. Inducibility of defence may serve to save energy and to prevent self-intoxication but also implies that there is a delay in these defences becoming operational. Induced defences can be characterized by alterations in plant morphology and molecular chemistry and are associated with a decrease in herbivore performance. These alterations are set in motion by signals generated by herbivores. Finally, a subset of induced metabolites are released into the air as volatiles and function as a beacon for foraging natural enemies searching for prey, and this is referred to as induced indirect defence. Scope The objective of this review is to evaluate (1) which strategies plants have evolved to cope with herbivores and (2) which traits herbivores have evolved that enable them to counter these defences. The primary focus is on the induction and suppression of plant defences and the review outlines how the palette of traits that determine induction/suppression of, and resistance/susceptibility of herbivores to, plant defences can give rise to exploitative competition and facilitation within ecological communities "inhabiting" a plant. Conclusions Herbivores have evolved diverse strategies, which are not mutually exclusive, to decrease the negative effects of plant defences in order to maximize the conversion of plant material into offspring. Numerous adaptations have been found in herbivores, enabling them to dismantle or bypass defensive barriers, to avoid tissues with relatively high levels of defensive chemicals or to metabolize these chemicals once ingested. In addition, some herbivores interfere with the onset or completion of induced plant defences, resulting in the plant's resistance being partly or fully suppressed. The ability to suppress induced plant defences appears to occur across plant parasites from different kingdoms, including herbivorous arthropods, and there is remarkable diversity in suppression mechanisms. Suppression may strongly affect the structure of the food web, because the ability to suppress the activation of defences of a communal host may facilitate competitors, whereas the ability of a herbivore to cope with activated plant defences will not. Further characterization of the mechanisms and traits that give rise to suppression of plant defences will enable us to determine their role in shaping direct and indirect interactions in food webs and the extent to which these determine the coexistence and persistence of species.},

abstract = {Assembly history, including the order in which species arrive into a community, can influence long-term community structure; however we know less about how timing of species arrival may alter assembly especially under varying resource conditions. To explore how the timing of species arrival interacts with resource availability to alter community assembly, we constructed experimental plant communities and manipulated the interval between plantings of groups of seedlings (0, 5, 10, 15 or 20 days) at low and high levels of soil nutrient supply. To see if community changes influenced ecosystem-scale processes, we measured parameters across the plant-soil continuum (e.g. plant biomass and net ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange). We found that the timing of species arrival had a large impact on community assembly, but the size of the effect depended on soil fertility. As planting interval increased, plant communities diverged further from the control, but the divergence was stronger at high than at low nutrient supply. Our data suggest that at high nutrient supply, early-planted species preempted light resources more quickly, thus preventing the successful establishment of later arriving species even at short planting intervals. Finally, we found that assembly related divergence in plant communities scaled to impact ecosystem-level characteristics such as green leaf chemistry, but had little effect on total community biomass and net ecosystem exchange of CO2 and water vapor. Our data indicate that the effect of a stochastic factor, here the timing of species arrival on community composition, depends on the resource level under which the community assembles. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {ABSTRACT The twospotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) is an important agricultural pest. Population dynamics and pest outbreaks highly depend on the overwintering success of the mite specimens; therefore, it is necessary to assess winter survival dynamics of this pest. Seasonal changes in supercooling point (SCP) and acute cold tolerance (2-h exposure at -5, 10, -15, -20, -23, or -25°C) were assessed in field-collected females during the winter in 2010-2011 in Iran. The SCP values varied from a minimum of -30.5°C (January 2011) to a maximum of -12.6°C (April 2011 ). Significant differences were recorded in the SCP distribution patterns between autumn-and winter-sampled females, depicting the acquisition of cold hardiness over the winter. The mean ambient air temperature was the lowest in January (4°C), when the females showed the highest supercooling ability. Correlated patterns between monthly temperatures and acute cold tolerance also were found. At -20°C, the survival of the mites was very low (10%) when they were sampled in October 2010; whereas it was high (97.5%) in January 2011, before decreasing to 5% in April 2011. The present data show that T. urticae females are chill tolerant and capable of adjusting their cold tolerance over the winter season. Acute cold tolerance ( -15 and -20°C) and SCP represent valuable metrics that can be used for predicting the seasonal changes of the cold hardiness of T. urticae females. {\textcopyright} 2013 Entomological Society of America.},

abstract = {Plant effects on soil biota can result in feedbacks affecting plant performance, with consequences for plant community and ecosystem dynamics on short and long time-scales. In addition, the strength and direction of plant-soil feedbacks depend on temporal shifts in abiotic environmental conditions. We synthesize current knowledge on temporal aspects of plant-soil feedbacks and present new ideas to better understand and predict the effects of plant-soil feedbacks on community and ecosystem properties across temporal scales. Explaining short-term temporal feedback dynamics requires us to better understand mechanistic linkages between plants, soil organisms and locally available resources. On the other hand, we need to refine our understanding of the context-dependency of plant-soil feedbacks, as the strength and direction of feedback interactions are influenced by 'external' temporal ecosystem dynamics, such as variation in soil resource availability after disturbance or during succession. Synthesis. Based on our synthesis of temporal aspects of plant-soil feedbacks, we suggest three main avenues for future research: (i) how plant-soil feedbacks changes with ontogeny, (ii) how plant and soil organism traits drive temporal variation in plant-soil feedbacks and (iii) how environmental changes across temporal scales alter the strength and direction of plant-soil feedbacks. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {In natural and agricultural conditions, plants are attacked by a community of herbivores, including aphids and mites. The green peach aphid and the two-spotted spider mite, both economically important pests, may share the same plant. Therefore, an important question arises as to how plants integrate signals induced by dual herbivore attack into the optimal defensive response. We showed that regardless of which attacker was first, 24 h of infestation allowed for efficient priming of the Arabidopsis defense, which decreased the reproductive performance of one of the subsequent herbivores. The expression analysis of several defense-related genes demonstrated that the individual impact of mite and aphid feeding spread systematically, engaging the salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways. Interestingly, aphids feeding on the systemic leaf of the plant simultaneously attacked by mites, efficiently reduced the magnitude of the SA and JA activation, whereas mites feeding remotely increased the aphid-induced SA marker gene expression, while the JA-dependent response was completely abolished. We also indicated that the weaker performance of mites and aphids in double infestation essays might be attributed to aliphatic glucosinolates. Our report is the first to provide molecular data on signaling cross-talk when representatives of two distinct taxonomical classes within the phylum Arthropoda co-infest the same plant.},

We found interactive effects of all three factors on fungal species composition and wood decomposition 1 year after the fungi were introduced. The strength of priority effects on community structure was affected primarily by nitrogen availability, whereas the strength of priority effects on decomposition rate was interactively regulated by nitrogen and fungivores.

Despite increasing prominence and shared goals, their compatibility and complementarity have received little attention. This paucity of overlap not only presents an obstacle to newcomers to the field, but it also precludes further conceptual advances at their interface. Here, we present a synthetic treatment of the two frameworks. We review their main concepts and explore their theoretical and empirical relationship, focusing on how the resource supply ratio, impact niche, and requirement niche of contemporary niche theory translate into the stabilizing and equalizing processes of modern coexistence theory. We show, for a general consumer–resource model, that varying resource supply ratios reflects an equalizing process; varying impact niche overlap reflects a stabilizing process; and varying requirement niche overlap may be both stabilizing and equalizing, but has no qualitative effect on coexistence. These generalizations provide mechanistic insight into modern coexistence theory, while also clarifying the role of contemporary niche theory's impacts and requirements in mediating coexistence. From an empirical perspective, we recommend a hierarchical approach, in which quantification of the strength of stabilizing mechanisms is used to guide more focused investigation into the underlying niche factors determining species coexistence. Future research that considers alternative assumptions, including different forms of species interaction, spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and priority effects, would facilitate a more complete synthesis of the two frameworks.},

abstract = {The rapid anthropogenic climate change that is being experienced in the early twenty-first century is intimately entwined with the health and functioning of the biosphere. Climate change is impacting ecosystems through changes in mean conditions and in climate variability, coupled with other associated changes such as increased ocean acidification and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. It also interacts with other pressures on ecosystems, including degradation, defaunation and fragmentation. There is a need to understand the ecological dynamics of these climate impacts, to identify hotspots of vulnerability and resilience and to identify management interventions that may assist biosphere resilience to climate change. At the same time, ecosystems can also assist in the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change. The mechanisms, potential and limits of such nature-based solutions to climate change need to be explored and quantified. This paper introduces a thematic issue dedicated to the interaction between climate change and the biosphere. It explores novel perspectives on how ecosystems respond to climate change, how ecosystem resilience can be enhanced and how ecosystems can assist in addressing the challenge of a changing climate. It draws on a Royal Society-National Academy of Sciences Forum held in Washington DC in November 2018, where these themes and issues were discussed. We conclude by identifying some priorities for academic research and practical implementation, in order to maximize the potential for maintaining a diverse, resilient and well-functioning biosphere under the challenging conditions of the twenty-first century.},

Ecological drift, dispersal and biotic interactions also structure communities, and although these mechanisms are more difficult to detect, they may be of equal importance in natural communities. Here, we hypothesized that in 10 naturally replicated headwater streams in eastern Switzerland, locally dominant amphipod species would be associated with differences in environmental conditions. We conducted repeated surveys of amphipods and used a hierarchical joint species distribution model to assess the influence of different drivers on species co-occurrences. The species had unique environmental requirements, but a distinct spatial structure in their distributions was unrelated to habitat. Species co-occurred much less frequently than predicted by the model, which was surprising because laboratory and field evidence suggests they are capable of coexisting in equal densities. We suggest that niche preemption may limit their distribution and that a blocking effect related to the specific linear configuration of streams determines which species colonizes and dominates a given stream catchment, thus suggesting a new solution a long-standing conundrum in freshwater ecology.},

abstract = {Among the factors limiting species distribution, low temperatures play a key role for tropical invasive species in temperate areas. Susceptibility to cold winter conditions has been recognized as the limiting factor in Europe for Tetranychus evansi, an invasive spider mite feeding on Solanaceous plants originated from tropical South America and now present on every continent except Australia. Two genetically distinct lineages of this species were introduced to Europe; one (lineage 1) is widely distributed, while the other (lineage 2) has a limited distribution. Whether this difference corresponds to differences in cold hardiness is evaluated here by assessing phenotypic response of T. evansi to the winter conditions that the mite encounters in the coldest parts of the current invaded area. We designed the thermal regimes to mimic winter conditions, including temperature fluctuations between day and night (L:D 8:16, 12:4 °C) and exposed mites to this regime for 5, 10 or 15 weeks. We tested T. evansi from three locations, one from the tropical native area (Piracicaba, Brazil) and two, corresponding to the two introduced lineages, from the temperate invaded area (lineage 1 from Nice and lineage 2 from Perpignan, France). After 5 weeks of treatment, mites from all the locations showed high survival rates but the two introduced populations grew, producing more than one offspring per female. After 10 weeks, survival rates declined for mites from Brazil and Perpignan, but not Nice. After 15 weeks, only the mites from Nice survived and produced offspring. Thus, mites belonging to the widespread lineage 1 exhibit increased cold tolerance suggesting broader adaptability, helping to explain its current geographical distribution.},

Progressively later initiation of mating resulted in higher peak proportions of females produced, up to an 8-day period between emergence and mating at 30°C. The proportion of male offspring always increased towards the end of the oviposition period, apparently because of sperm depletion.

Despite this, the practical aspects of studying them often require some simplification, such as the widespread assumption that direct, additive competition captures the important details about how interactions between species impact community diversity. More complex non-additive 'higher-order' interactions are assumed to be negligible or absent. Notably, these assumptions are poorly supported and have major consequences for the accuracy with which patterns of natural diversity are modelled and explained. We present a mathematically simple framework for incorporating biologically meaningful complexity into models of diversity by including non-additive higher-order interactions. We further provide empirical evidence that such higher-order interactions strongly influence species' performance in natural plant communities, with variation in seed production (as a proxy for per capita fitness) explained dramatically better when at least some higher-order interactions are considered. Our study lays the groundwork for a long-overdue shift in how species interactions are used to study the diversity of natural communities.},

abstract = {Modeling the dynamics of competition and coexistence between species is crucial to predict long-term impacts of invasive species on their native congeners. However, natural environments are often fragmented and variable in time and space. In such contexts, regional coexistence depends on complex interactions between competition, niche differentiation and stochastic colonization–extinction dynamics. Quantifying all these processes at landscape scale has always been a challenge for ecologists. We propose a new statistical framework to evaluate metapopulation parameters (colonization and extinction) in a two-species system and how they respond to environmental variables and interspecific competition. It requires spatial surveys repeated in time, but does not assume demographic equilibrium. We apply this model to a long-term survey of two snails inhabiting a network of freshwater habitats in the West Indies. We find evidence of reciprocal competition affecting colonization or extinction rates, modulated by species-specific sensitivity to environmental variables. Simulations using model estimates allow us to predict species dynamics and explore the role of various coexistence mechanisms described by metacommunity theory in our system. The two species are predicted to stably coexist, because niche partitioning, source–sink dynamics and interspecific differences in extinction–colonization parameters all contribute to reduce the negative impacts of competition. However, none of these mechanisms is individually essential. Regional coexistence is primarily facilitated by transient co-occurrence of the two species within habitat patches, a possibility generally not considered in theoretical metacommunity models. Our framework is general and could be extended to guilds of several competing species.},

abstract = {The assembly of many biological communities is constrained by the resistance exerted by resident species to immigration (biotic resistance). Two important mechanisms contribute to the generation of biotic resistance: diversity resistance and priority effects. These mechanisms have been explored through theoretical models and laboratory experiments, but the importance of their interplay in the assembly of natural communities remains untested. We used a mesocosm experiment with communities of aquatic plants and zooplankton assembled from natural propagule banks to test whether and how diversity resistance, mediated by the diversity of the resident community, and priority effects, mediated by the timing of immigrants' arrival, affect the establishment of immigrant species and community diversity. In plant communities, immigration success decreased with increasing resident-species richness (diversity resistance) and arrival time (priority effects). Further, diversity resistance was stronger in communities colonized later in the season, indicating that these mechanisms interacted to reinforce biotic resistance. This interaction ultimately determined species richness and beta-diversity in plant communities. For zooplankton, in contrast, neither the diversity of resident communities nor the time of arrival affected the establishment of immigrant species. In these communities, beta-diversity was explained by species sorting, namely biotic effects mediated by plant assemblages. Our results show that the progressive buildup of communities generates an interaction between diversity resistance and priority effects that eventually determines community diversity, unless species sorting mediated by environmental filtering supersedes the effect of biotic resistance. Therefore, disentangling the mechanisms underlying biotic resistance contributes to understand how species diversity is ultimately determined.},

abstract = {Insects and pathogens frequently exploit the same host plant and can potentially impact each other's performance. However, studies on plant-pathogen-insect interactions have mainly focused on a fixed temporal setting or on a single interaction partner. In this study, we assessed the impact of time of attacker arrival on the outcome and symmetry of interactions between aphids (Tuberculatus annulatus), powdery mildew (Erysiphe alphitoides), and caterpillars (Phalera bucephala) feeding on pedunculate oak, Quercus robur, and explored how single versus multiple attackers affect oak performance. We used a multifactorial greenhouse experiment in which oak seedlings were infected with either zero, one, two, or three attackers, with the order of attacker arrival differing among treatments. The performances of all involved organisms were monitored throughout the experiment. Overall, attackers had a weak and inconsistent impact on plant performance. Interactions between attackers, when present, were asymmetric. For example, aphids performed worse, but powdery mildew performed better, when co-occurring. Order of arrival strongly affected the outcome of interactions, and early attackers modified the strength and direction of interactions between later-arriving attackers. Our study shows that interactions between plant attackers can be asymmetric, time-dependent, and species specific. This is likely to shape the ecology and evolution of plant-pathogen-insect interactions.},

abstract = {Microbes are capable of physiologically adapting to diverse environmental conditions by differentially varying the rates at which they uptake different nutrients. In particular, microbes can switch hierarchically between different energy sources, consuming first those that ensure the highest growth rate. Experimentally, this can result in biphasic growth curves called "diauxic shifts" that typically arise when microbes are grown in media containing several nutrients. Despite these observations are well known in microbiology and molecular biology, the mathematical models generally used to describe the population dynamics of microbial communities do not account for dynamic metabolic adaptation, thus implicitly assuming that microbes cannot switch dynamically from one resource to another. Here, we introduce dynamic metabolic adaptation in the framework of consumer-resource models, which are commonly used to describe competitive microbial communities, allowing each species to temporally change its preferred energy source to maximize its own relative fitness. We show that dynamic metabolic adaptation enables the community to self-organize, allowing several species to coexist even in the presence of few resources, and to respond optimally to a time-dependent environment, thus showing that dynamic metabolic adaptation could be an important mechanism for maintaining high levels of diversity even in environments with few energy sources. We show that introducing dynamic metabolic strategies in consumer-resource models is necessary for reproducing experimental growth curves of the baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae growing in the presence of two carbon sources. Even though diauxic shifts emerge naturally from the model when two resources are qualitatively very different, the model predicts that the existence of such shifts is not a prerequisite for species coexistence in competitive communities.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that selection can allow coexistence in situations where ecological dynamics lead to competitive exclusion, provided that there is a trade-off between traits optimal for interacting with conspecifics and traits optimal for interacting with heterospecifics. Despite compelling empirical evidence, there is no general framework for elucidating how and when selection will allow coexistence in natural communities. Here we develop such a framework for a mechanism that we term "neighbor-dependent selection." We show that this mechanism can both augment coexistence when ecological conditions allow for niche partitioning and enable coexistence when ecological conditions lead to competitive exclusion. The novel insight is that when ecological conditions lead to exclusion, neighbor-dependent selection can allow coexistence via cycles driven by an intransitive loop; selection causes one species to be a superior interspecific competitor when it is rare and an inferior interspecific competitor when it is abundant. Our framework predicts the conditions under which selection can enable coexistence, as opposed to merely augmenting it, and elucidates the effects of heritability on the eco-evolutionary feedbacks that drive coexistence. Given increasing evidence that evolution operates on ecological timescales, our approach provides one means for evaluating the role of selection and trait evolution in species coexistence. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract = {Induced changes in plant quality can mediate indirect interactions between herbivores. Although the sequence of attack by different herbivores has been shown to influence plant responses, little is known about how this affects the herbivores themselves. We therefore investigated how induction by the leaf herbivore Spodoptera frugiperda influences resistance of teosinte (Zea mays mexicana) and cultivated maize (Zea mays mays) against root-feeding larvae of Diabrotica virgifera virgifera. The importance of the sequence of arrival was tested in the field and laboratory. Spodoptera frugiperda infestation had a significant negative effect on colonization by D. virgifera larvae in the field and weight gain in the laboratory, but only when S. frugiperda arrived on the plant before the root herbivore. When S. frugiperda arrived after the root herbivore had established, no negative effects on larval performance were detected. Yet, adult emergence of D. virgifera was reduced even when the root feeder had established first, indicating that the negative effects were not entirely absent in this treatment. The defoliation of the plants was not a decisive factor for the negative effects on root herbivore development, as both minor and major leaf damage resulted in an increase in root resistance and the extent of biomass removal was not correlated with root-herbivore growth. We propose that leaf-herbivore-induced increases in feeding-deterrent and/or toxic secondary metabolites may account for the sequence-specific reduction in root-herbivore performance. Synthesis. Our results demonstrate that the sequence of arrival can be an important determinant of plant-mediated interactions between insect herbivores in both wild and cultivated plants. Arriving early on a plant may be an important strategy of insects to avoid competition with other herbivores. To fully understand plant-mediated interactions between insect herbivores, the sequence of arrival should be taken into account. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

Afterwards, this species spread within Mediterranean countries. However, the species is also known on other plant families and can be present but disregarded on non-crop plants. T. evansi is polyphagous, but the major hosts are within the Solanaceae. The primary cultivated solanaceous hosts in Portugal are tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum), potato (Solanum tuberosum), aubergine (Solanum melongena), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), and to a lesser degree pepper (Capsicum annuum). In this country, some aromatic plants and strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) are cultivated non-solanaceous hosts, and Lantana camara is an ornamental non-solanaceous host. The preferred weed host for T. evansi is the widespread Solanum nigrum. Other weed hosts in Portugal include Amaranthaceae, Asteraceae, Boraginaceae, Brassicaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Convolvulaceae, Cyperaceae, Malvaceae, Poaceae, Polygonaceae, and Solanaceae. T. evansi has been found in Portugal from Minho to Algarve, with the exception of Tr{\'{a}}s-os-Montes, Alto Douro, and Beira Alta, but it is more frequent in the centre and south of the country.

This concept focuses on stable states, yet many real communities are kept in a transient state by disturbance, and the utility of predictions for stable states in explaining transient states remains unclear. Using a simple model of plant community assembly, we show that the conditions under which historical contingency affects community assembly can differ greatly for stable versus transient states. Differences arise because the contribution of such factors as mortality rate, environmental heterogeneity and plant-soil feedback to historical contingency changes as community assembly proceeds. We also show that transient states can last for a long time relative to immigration rate and generation time. These results argue for a conceptual shift of focus from alternative stable states to alternative transient states for understanding historical contingency in community assembly. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

However, little is known as to how assembly history may affect ecosystem functioning via its effect on community structure. Using wood-decaying fungi as a model system, we provide experimental evidence that large differences in ecosystem functioning can be caused by small differences in species immigration history during community assembly. Direct manipulation of early immigration history resulted in three-fold differences in fungal species richness and composition and, as a consequence, differences of the same magnitude in the rate of decomposition and carbon release from wood. These effects - which were attributable to the history-dependent outcome of competitive and facilitative interactions - were significant across a range of nitrogen availabilities observed in natural forests.

abstract = {Background: The tomato red spider mite, Tetranychus evansi Baker & Pritchard (Acari: Tetranychidae), is an agricultural pest of solanaceous crops. Although T. evansi is of South American subtropical origin, it has recently expanded its distribution range to many tropical and temperate areas around the world. Its potential distribution range in response to scenarios of global warming was recently modeled, confirming its current and possible future distributions. Here, we experimentally investigated the biological traits of T. evansi in the context of the current and future global warming (2100) scenarios. Using an environmental simulation system, we tested the life-history traits of T. evansi under current summer temperatures (as of June, July, and August 2016) and under expected temperature increases based on two IPCC scenarios: RCP2.6 (+ 1 °C) and RCP8.5 (+ 3.7 °C). The mites were introduced into each scenario on 1 June and their sequential progeny were used for testing in each following month. Results: The mite could develop and reproduce under all scenarios. There was a decrease in the duration of lifespan and female fecundity at RCP8.5 during June and August, but this may be compensated for by the high intrinsic rate of increase, which implies faster population growth and shorter generation time. Conclusion: Our study and other reports reveal the high adaptability of T. evansi to a wide range of summer temperatures; this may explain its current distribution. We anticipate that global warming will favor the spread of T. evansi and may further expand its distribution to a large area of the globe. These findings should be of ecological and practical relevance for designing prevention and control strategies.},

It also has a potent effect on increasing the proline pool during collagen production, but the details underlying the boosting effect on collagen production by alpha-ketoglutarate remain as yet unreported. To investigate the effects of alpha-ketoglutarate on procollagen production and wrinkle formation, we conducted experiments in cultured human dermal fibroblasts and UVB-irradiated hairless mice. Based on ELISA measurements, alpha-ketoglutarate (10 microM) stimulated procollagen production in fibroblasts by 25.6+/-4.6% compared to vehicle (dH(2)O)-treated control cells. Also, we demonstrated that alpha-ketoglutarate increased activities of prolidase, which is known to play an important role in collagen metabolism, in fibroblasts and N-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-proline (Cbz-Pro), prolidase inhibitor, inhibited procollagen synthesis by alpha-ketoglutarate in fibroblasts. To determine the effect of topically applied alpha-ketoglutarate on wrinkle formation, alpha-ketoglutarate (1%) and vehicle (70% propylene glycol, 30% ethanol) were applied on the dorsal skin of UVB-induced hairless mice for twelve weeks. We found that alpha-ketoglutarate decreased wrinkle formation upon long-term topical application. These results suggest that alpha-ketoglutarate diminishes UVB-induced wrinkle formation by increasing collagen production, through a pathway that involves prolidase activation. Therefore, application of alpha-ketoglutarate may represent an effective anti-wrinkle agent for the cosmetic field.},

abstract = {Priority effects occur when species that arrive first in a habitat significantly affect the establishment, growth, or reproduction of species arriving later and thus affect functioning of communities. However, we know little about how the timing of arrival of functionally different species may alter structure and function during assembly. Even less is known about how plant density might interact with initial assembly. In a greenhouse experiment legumes, grasses or forbs were sown a number of weeks before the other two plant functional types were sown (PFT) in combination with a sowing density treatment. Legumes, grasses or non-legume forbs were sown first at three different density levels followed by sowing of the remaining PFTs after three or six-weeks. We found that the order of arrival of different plant functional types had a much stronger influence on aboveground productivity than sowing density or interval between the sowing events. The sowing of legumes before the other PFTs produced the highest aboveground biomass. The larger sowing interval led to higher asymmetric competition, with highest dominance of the PFT sown first. It seems that legumes were better able to get a head-start and be productive before the later groups arrived, but that their traits allowed for better subsequent establishment of non-legume PFTs. Our study indicates that the manipulation of the order of arrival can create priority effects which favour functional groups of plants differently and thus induce different assembly routes and affect community composition and functioning. {\textcopyright} 2014 von Gillhaussen et al.},

Here, we ask whether species potential for recruitment and the strength of density-dependent processes, both inferred from species relative abundances, show emerging patterns that can be explained upon the basis of information about climate and functional traits. Location: Eastern forests of the USA. Methods: We document the geographical distributions and magnitudes of seedling recruitment and the strength of density dependence and conspecific density dependence for the forests of the eastern USA spanning >1.2 million km2 across 88,854 local communities comprising 164 tree species. We also compiled climatic variables and 16 traits representing several important ecological axes of tree functional strategies to assess which factors were most strongly associated with the emerging broad-scale spatial patterns. Results: Strong geographical variation in the potential for seedling recruitment and a latitudinal change from negative to positive density dependence moving northward were associated with adaptation to seasonal freezing temperatures and seed size. Wood density and leaf nitrogen, in contrast, were related to the magnitude of the negative density dependence and conspecific density dependence, respectively, which were prevalent over most of the region. Main conclusions: Our results provide strong evidence that tree recruitment and the strength of density-dependent processes have broad-scale patterns that can be explained by a few key species functional traits.},

In 2001 this species was also found in Japan, on nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.), and its invasion to solanaceous of agricultural importance is feasible. To evaluate its potential severity as a pest, the present study assessed the life-history parameters, such as the rate of development and the intrinsic rate of natural increase (rm), on S. nigrum for T. evansi collected on seven sites worldwide. Increasing temperatures between 15 and 32.5°C significantly increased the developmental rate of the seven strains while immature developmental duration was about the same at 32.5-40°C. The rate of egg-to-adult development [(% hatch) × (% survival)] exceeded 88% at temperatures between 15 and 37.5°C. The lower thermal thresholds (LT) were 11.9-12.5°C for both egg-to-adult and egg-to-egg development. The optimum developmental temperatures ranged from 36.7 to 43.8°C and the upper developmental threshold (UT) ranged from 45.2 to 59.4°C. The rm-values became higher with temperature increasing from 15 to 35°C. The rm-values at 25°C ranged from 0.265 to 0.277 which are relatively high for species of the genus Tetranychus.

abstract = {The order of species arrival at a site can determine the outcome of competitive interactions when early arrivers alter the environment or deplete shared resources. These priority effects are predicted to be stronger at high temperatures, as higher vital rates caused by warming allow early arrivers to more rapidly impact a shared environment. We tested this prediction using a pair of congeneric aphid species that specialize on milkweed plants. We manipulated temperature and arrival order of the two aphid species and measured aphid population dynamics and milkweed survival and defensive traits. We found that warming increased the impact of aphids on the quantity and quality of milkweed, which amplified the importance of priority effects by increasing the competitive exclusion of the inferior competitor when it arrived late. Warming also enhanced interspecific differences in dispersal, which could alter relative arrival times at a regional scale. Our experiment provides a first link between temperature-dependent trophic interactions, priority effects, and dispersal. This study suggests that the indirect and cascading effects of temperature observed here may be important determinants of diversity in the temporally and spatially complex landscapes that characterize ecological communities.},

abstract = {The contribution of deterministic and stochastic processes to species coexistence is widely debated. With the introduction of powerful statistical techniques, we can now better characterise different sources of uncertainty when quantifying niche differentiation. The theoretical literature on the effect of stochasticity on coexistence, however, is often ignored by field ecologists because of its technical nature and difficulties in its application.

With the introduction of powerful statistical techniques, we can now better characterise different sources of uncertainty when quantifying niche differentiation.

@article{Gurevitch1992,
abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted on field-competition experiments published in six journals over a 10-yr period, analyzing the effects of competition on the biomass of organisms belonging to 93 species in a wide variety of habitats. Competition had a large effect overall, with a great deal of heterogeneity in that effect among organisms. There were large differences among trophic levels in competitive effects, but the relative magnitude of competition at different trophic levels was contrary to the predictions of ecological theory. Primary producers and carnivores displayed small to medium effects. In these two groups, interspecific effects did not differ from intraspecific effects, nor did effects differ in terrestrial versus aquatic habitats. The effects of competition on herbivores ranged from large effects on anurans and lotic arthropods, to medium effects on marine mollusks and echinoderms, to effects that were not statistically distinguishable from zero for terrestrial arthopods. Interspecific competitive effects among these herbivore groups were generally less than intraspecific effects. Among primary producers, the effects of competition were not different in high- and low-productivity habitats. Across all taxa, large organisms did not experience greater competitive effects than small organisms, and competitive effects did not depend on the size attained in the absence of competitors. The effects of competition were weakly density-dependent in cases in which it was possible to examine the effects of the density of neighbors. -from Authors},

abstract = {The observation that species may be positively or negatively associated with each other is at least as old as the debate surrounding the nature of community structure which began in the early 1900's with Gleason and Clements. Since then investigating species co-occurrence patterns has taken a central role in understanding the causes and consequences of evolution, history, coexistence mechanisms, competition, and environment for community structure and assembly. This is because co-occurrence among species is a measurable metric in community datasets that, in the context of phylogeny, geography, traits, and environment, can sometimes indicate the degree of competition, displacement, and phylogenetic repulsion as weighed against biotic and environmental effects promoting correlated species distributions. Historically, a multitude of different co-occurrence metrics have been developed and most have depended on data randomization procedures to produce null distributions for significance testing. Here we improve upon and present an R implementation of a recently published model that is metric-free, distribution-free, and randomization-free. The R package, cooccur, is highly accessible, easily integrates into common analyses, and handles large datasets with high performance. In the article we develop the package's functionality and demonstrate aspects of co-occurrence analysis using three sample datasets.},

abstract = {Understanding the role of competition in structuring communities requires that we quantify competitive ability in a way that permits us to predict the outcome of competition over the long term. Given such a clear goal for a process that has been the focus of ecological research for decades, there is surprisingly little consensus on how to measure competitive ability, with up to 50 different metrics currently proposed. Using competitive population dynamics as a foundation, we define competitive ability—the ability of one species to exclude another—using quantitative theoretical models of population dynamics to isolate the key parameters that are known to predict competitive outcomes. Based on the definition of competitive ability we identify the empirical requirements and describe straightforward methods for quantifying competitive ability in future empirical studies. In doing so, our analysis also allows us to identify why many existing approaches to studying competition are unsuitable for quantifying competitive ability. Synthesis. Competitive ability is precisely defined starting from models of competitive population dynamics. Quantifying competitive ability in a theoretically justified manner is straightforward using experimental designs readily applied to studies of competition in the laboratory and field.},

abstract = {Host individuals are often coinfected with diverse parasite assemblages, resulting in complex interactions among parasites within hosts. Within hosts, priority effects occur when the infection sequence alters the outcome of interactions among parasites. Yet, the role of host immunity in this process remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that the host response to first infection could generate priority effects among parasites, altering the assembly of later arriving strains during epidemics. We tested this by infecting sentinel host genotypes of Plantago lanceolata with strains of the fungal parasite, Podosphaera plantaginis, and measuring susceptibility to subsequent infection during experimental and natural epidemics. In these experiments, prior infection by one strain often increased susceptibility to other strains, and these facilitative priority effects altered the structure of parasite assemblages, but this effect depended on host genotype, host population, and parasite genotype. Thus, host genotype, spatial structure, and priority effects among strains all independently altered parasite assembly. Then, using a fine-scale survey and sampling of infections on wild hosts in several populations, we identified a signal of facilitative priority effects, which altered parasite assembly during natural epidemics. Together, these results provide evidence that within host priority effects by early arriving strains can drive parasite assembly, with implications for how strain diversity is spatially and temporally distributed during epidemics.},

abstract = {A major challenge in ecological research is to identify the tolerance of ecological communities to external perturbations. Modern coexistence theory (MCT) has been widely adopted as a framework to investigate the tolerance to perturbations in relative reductions of per capita growth rates, often using metrics that explicitly eliminate the independent role of intrinsic growth rates. More recently, the structural approach (SA) was introduced to investigate the tolerance of communities to perturbations in intrinsic growth rates as a function of the strength of intraspecific and interspecific competition. Because the external perturbations are likely to happen in both intrinsic growth rates and competition strengths, no framework alone can fully disentangle the effects of external perturbations. Here we combine MCT and SA to disentangle the tolerance in coexistence and priority effects of a pair of competing species when subject to perturbations in intrinsic growth rates and competition strengths. Through this combination, we reveal the emergence of a key trade-off: increasing the tolerance to perturbations in intrinsic growth rates typically decreases the tolerance in competition strengths, and vice versa. Furthermore, this trade-off is stronger under coexistence than under priority effects. We test this combined framework on competing pairs of 18 California annual plant species. For both coexistence and priority effects, we find that the tolerance to perturbations in intrinsic growth rates is maximized instead of that to perturbations in competition strengths in the studied annual plant communities. Synthesis. Our combined framework of modern coexistence theory and structural approach illustrates that it is possible to disentangle the impact of different external perturbations on the persistence of species. Importantly, our findings show that species interactions may reveal whether communities are dominated either by changes in intrinsic growth rates or by competition strengths. Overall, this combined framework can open a new perspective to understand and predict the response of populations to changing environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Evolutionary biologists since Darwin have hypothesized that closely related species compete more intensely and are therefore less likely to coexist. However, recent theory posits that species diverge in two ways: either through the evolution of ‘stabilizing differences' that promote coexistence by causing individuals to compete more strongly with conspecifics than individuals of other species, or through the evolution of ‘fitness differences' that cause species to differ in competitive ability and lead to exclusion of the weaker competitor. We tested macroevolutionary patterns of divergence by competing pairs of annual plant species that differ in their phylogenetic relationships, and in whether they have historically occurred in the same region or different regions (sympatric versus allopatric occurrence). For sympatrically occurring species pairs, stabilizing differences rapidly increased with phylogenetic distance. However, fitness differences also increased with phylogenetic distance, resulting in coexistence outcomes that were unpredictable based on phylogenetic relationships. For allopatric species, stabilizing differences showed no trend with phylogenetic distance, whereas fitness differences increased, causing coexistence to become less likely among distant relatives. Our results illustrate the role of species' historical interactions in shaping how phylogenetic relationships structure competitive dynamics, and offer an explanation for the evolution of invasion potential of non-native species.},

Ecological theory suggests that community development is often influenced by priority effects, in which the order and timing of species arrival determine how species affect one another. Priority effects can have long-lasting consequences, particularly if species arrival history varies during the early stage of community development, but their importance to the human gut microbiota and host health remains largely unknown. Here, we explore how priority effects might influence microbial communities in the gastrointestinal tract during early childhood and how the strength of priority effects can be estimated from the composition of the microbial species pool. We also discuss factors that alter microbial transmission, such as delivery mode, diet and parenting behaviours such as breastfeeding, which can influence the likelihood of priority effects. An improved knowledge of priority effects has the potential to inform microorganism-based therapies, such as prebiotics and probiotics, which are aimed at guiding the microbiota towards a healthy state.},

abstract = {In plant–arthropod associations, the first herbivores to colonise a plant may directly or indirectly affect community assembly on that particular plant. Whether the order of arrival of different arthropod species further modulates community assembly and affects plant fitness remains unclear. Using wild Brassica oleracea plants in the field, we manipulated the order of arrival of early-season herbivores that belong to different feeding guilds, namely the aphid Brevicoryne brassicae and caterpillars of Plutella xylostella. We investigated the effect of herbivore identity and order of arrival on community assembly on two B. oleracea plant populations during two growth seasons. For this perennial plant, we evaluated whether foliar herbivory also affected herbivore communities on the flowers and if these interactions affected plant seed production. Aphid infestation caused an increase in parasitoid abundance, but caterpillars modulated these effects, depending on the order of herbivore infestation and plant population. In the second growth season, when plants flowered, the order of infestation of leaves with aphids and caterpillars more strongly affected abundance of herbivores feeding on the flowers than those feeding on leaves. Infestation with caterpillars followed by aphids caused an increase in flower-feeding herbivores compared to the reversed order of infestation in one plant population, whereas the opposite effects were observed for the other plant population. The impact on plant seed set in the first reproductive year was limited. Our work shows that the identity and arrival order of early season herbivores may have long-term consequences for community composition on individual plants and that these patterns may vary among plant populations. We discuss how these community processes may affect plant fitness and speculate on the implications for evolution of plant defences.},

abstract = {1. Plants are frequently under attack by multiple insect herbivores, which may interact indirectly through herbivore-induced changes in the plant's phenotype. The identity, order, and timing of herbivore arrivals may influence the outcome of interactions between two herbivores. How these aspects affect, in turn, subsequently arriving herbivores that feed on double herbivore-induced plants has not been widely investigated. 2. This study tested whether the order and timing of arrival of two inducing herbivores from different feeding guilds affected the preference and performance of a subsequently arriving third herbivore, caterpillars of Mamestra brassicae L. (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Aphids [Brevicoryne brassicae L. (Hemiptera: Aphididae)] and caterpillars [Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae)] were introduced onto wild Brassica oleracea L. (Brassicaceae) plants in different sequences and with different arrival times. The effects of these plant treatments on M. brassicae caterpillars were assessed in pairwise preference tests and no-choice performance tests. 3. The caterpillars of M. brassicae preferred to feed from undamaged plants rather than double herbivore-induced plants. Compared with undamaged plants, they preferred plant material on which aphids had arrived first followed by caterpillars, whereas they avoided plant material with the reverse order of herbivore arrival. Performance of the caterpillars increased with increasing arrival time between herbivore infestations in double herbivore-induced plants. Although M. brassicae grew faster on plants induced by aphids than on those induced by caterpillars alone, its performance was not affected by the order of previous herbivore arrival. 4. These results imply that the timing of colonisation by multiple herbivores determines the outcome of plant-mediated herbivore–herbivore interactions.},

abstract = {In large clonal populations, several clones generally compete, resulting in complex evolutionary and ecological dynamics: experiments show successive selective sweeps of favorable mutations as well as long-term coexistence of multiple clonal strains. The mechanisms underlying either coexistence or fixation of several competing strains have rarely been studied altogether. Conditions for coexistence have mostly been studied by population and community ecology, while rates of invasion and fixation have mostly been studied by population genetics. To provide a global understanding of the complexity of the dynamics observed in large clonal populations, we develop a stochastic model where three clones compete. Competitive interactions can be intransitive, and we suppose that strains enter the population via mutations or rare immigrations. We first describe all possible final states of the population, including stable coexistence of two or three strains or the fixation of a single strain. Second, we estimate the invasion and fixation times of a favorable mutant (or im-migrant) entering the population in a single copy. We show that invasion and fixation can be slower or faster when considering complex competitive interactions. Third, we explore the parameter space assuming prior distributions of reproduction, death, and competition rates, and we estimate the likelihood of the possible dynamics. We show that when mutations can affect competitive interactions even slightly, stable coexistence is likely. We discuss our results in the context of the evolutionary dynamics of large clonal populations.},

An increase in available niche space, provision of refuges and opportunities for isolation and divergent adaptation are thought to enhance species coexistence, persistence and diversification. However, the extent and generality of positive heterogeneity-richness relationships are still debated. Apart from widespread evidence supporting positive relationships, negative and hump-shaped relationships have also been reported. In a meta-analysis of 1148 data points from 192 studies worldwide, we examine the strength and direction of the relationship between spatial environmental heterogeneity and species richness of terrestrial plants and animals. We find that separate effects of heterogeneity in land cover, vegetation, climate, soil and topography are significantly positive, with vegetation and topographic heterogeneity showing particularly strong associations with species richness. The use of equal-area study units, spatial grain and spatial extent emerge as key factors influencing the strength of heterogeneity-richness relationships, highlighting the pervasive influence of spatial scale in heterogeneity-richness studies. We provide the first quantitative support for the generality of positive heterogeneity-richness relationships across heterogeneity components, habitat types, taxa and spatial scales from landscape to global extents, and identify specific needs for future comparative heterogeneity-richness research. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects <70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {The positive relationship between spatial environmental heterogeneity and species diversity is a widely accepted concept, generally associated with niche limitation. However, niche limitation cannot account for negative heterogeneity-diversity relationships (HDR) revealed in several case studies. Here we explore how HDR varies at different spatial scales and provide novel theories for small-scale species co-existence that explain both positive and negative HDR. At large spatial scales of heterogeneity (e.g. landscape level), different communities co-exist, promoting large regional species pool size and resulting in positive HDR. At smaller scales within communities, species co-existence can be enhanced by increasing the number of different patches, as predicted by the niche limitation theory, or alternatively, restrained by heterogeneity. We conducted meta-regressions for experimental and observational HDR studies, and found that negative HDRs are significantly more common at smaller spatial scales. We propose three theories to account for niche limitation at small spatial scales. (1) Microfragmentation theory: with increasing spatial heterogeneity, large homogeneous patches lose area and become isolated, which in turn restrains the establishment of new plant individuals and populations, thus reducing species richness. (2) Heterogeneity confounded by mean: when heterogeneity occurs at spatial scales smaller than the size of individual plants, which forage through the patches, species diversity can be either positively or negatively affected by a change in the mean of an environmental factor. (3) Heterogeneity as a separate niche axis: the ability of species to tolerate heterogeneity at spatial scales smaller than plant size varies, affecting HDR. We conclude that processes other than niche limitation can affect the relationship between heterogeneity and diversity. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

abstract = {Diversity of species and order of arrival can have strong effects on ecosystem functioning and community composition, but these two have rarely been explicitly combined in experimental setups. We measured the effects of both species diversity and order of arrival on ecosystem function and community composition in a grassland field experiment, thus combining biodiversity and assembly approaches. We studied the effect of order of arrival of three plant functional groups (PFGs: grasses, legumes, and non-leguminous forbs) and of sowing low and high diversity seed mixtures (9 or 21 species) on species composition and aboveground biomass. The experiment was set up in two different soil types. Differences in PFG order of arrival affected the biomass, the number of species and community composition. As expected, we found higher aboveground biomass when sowing legumes before the other PFGs, but this effect was not continuous over time. We did not find a positive effect of sown diversity on aboveground biomass (even if it influenced species richness as expected). No interaction were found between the two studied factors. We found that sowing legumes first may be a good method for increasing productivity whilst maintaining diversity of central European grasslands, although the potential for long-lasting effects needs further study. In addition, the mechanisms behind the non-continuous priority effects we found need to be further researched, taking weather and plant-soil feedbacks into account.},

abstract = {The order of species arrival during community assembly can greatly affect species coexistence, but the strength of these effects, known as priority effects, appears highly variable across species and ecosystems. Furthermore, the causes of this variation remain unclear despite their fundamental importance in understanding species coexistence. Here, we show that one potential cause is environmental variability. In laboratory experiments using nectarinhabiting microorganisms as a model system, we manipulated spatial and temporal variability of temperature, and examined consequences for priority effects. If species arrived sequentially, multiple species coexisted under variable temperature, but not under constant temperature. Temperature variability prevented extinction of late-arriving species that would have been excluded owing to priority effects if temperature had been constant. By contrast, if species arrived simultaneously, species coexisted under both variable and constant temperatures.We propose possible mechanisms underlying these results using a mathematical model that incorporates contrasting effects of microbial species on nectar pH and amino acids. Overall, our findings suggest that understanding consequences of priority effects for species coexistence requires explicit consideration of environmental variability. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract = {Stochastic niche theory resolves many of the differences between neutral theory and classical tradeoff-based niche theories of resource competition and community structure. In stochastic niche theory, invading species become established only if propagules can survive stochastic mortality while growing to maturity on the resources left unconsumed by established species. The theory makes three predictions about community structure. First, stochastic niche assembly creates communities in which species dominate approximately equally wide "slices" of the habitat's spatial heterogeneity. These niche widths generate realistic distributions of species relative abundances for which, contrary to neutral theory but consistent with numerous observations, there are strong correlations among species traits, species abundances, and environmental conditions. Second, slight decreases in resource levels are predicted to cause large decreases in the probability that a propagule would survive to be an adult. These decreases cause local diversity to be limited by the inhibitory effects of resource use by established species on the establishment (recruitment) of potential invaders. If resource pulses or disturbance allowed invaders to overcome this recruitment limitation, many more species could indefinitely coexist. Third, the low invasibility of high diversity communities is predicted to result not from diversity per se, but from the uniformly low levels of resources that occur in high-diversity communities created by stochastic competitive assembly. This prediction provides a potential solution to the invasion paradox, which is the tendency for highly diverse regions to be more heavily invaded.},

abstract = {Plants have diverse ways of responding to damage by herbivores, such as changes in allelochemistry, physiology, morphology, growth, and phenology. These responses form the mechanistic basis for trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs) between organisms on the plants. There is a growing appreciation that such TMIIs form complex networks (i. e., indirect interaction webs) in terrestrial plant-associated arthropod communities. Almost all previous studies have had the same framework: examining trait-mediated indirect effects within a single interactive unit consisting of one initiator of herbivore, a host plant as a mediator, and one receiver [trait-mediated indirect interaction unit (TMIU)]. However, this framework is too simple to understand the dynamics of the indirect interaction web. Recent studies suggest that there is a wide variety of interactions among TMIUs within a community, which may largely affect the outcomes of indirect effects in each unit. Here, we review recent advance in studies of trait-mediated indirect effects in plant-associated arthropod communities and explore the mechanisms of linkages among TMIUs. Then, we argue the importance of examining linkages among TMIUs as a new framework for future studies on the indirect interaction web. Finally, we propose the hypothesis that linkages among TMIUs contribute to the maintenance of biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer.},

abstract = {Niche and fitness differences control the outcome of competition, but determining their relative importance in invaded communities—which may be far from equilibrium—remains a pressing concern. Moreover, it is unclear whether classic approaches for studying competition, which were developed predominantly for pairs of interacting species, will fully capture dynamics in complex species assemblages. We parameterized a population-dynamic model using competition experiments of two native and three exotic species from a grassland community. We found evidence for minimal fitness differences or niche differences between the native species, leading to slow replacement dynamics and priority effects, but large fitness advantages allowed exotics to unconditionally invade natives. Priority effects driven by strong interspecific competition between exotic species drove single-species dominance by one of two exotic species in 80% of model outcomes, while a complex mixture of nonhierarchical competition and coexistence between native and exotic species occurred in the remaining 20%. Fungal infection, a commonly hypothesized coexistence mechanism, had weak fitness effects and is unlikely to substantially affect coexistence. In contrast to previous work on pairwise outcomes in largely native-dominated communities, our work supports a role for nearly neutral dynamics and priority effects as drivers of species composition in invaded communities.},

abstract = {It has been widely accepted that herbivory induces morphological, phenological, and chemical changes in a wide variety of terrestrial plants. There is an increasing appreciation that herbivore-induced plant responses affect the performance and abundance of other arthropods. However, we still have a poor understanding of the effects of induced plant responses on community structures of arthropods. We examined the community-level effects of willow regrowth in response to damage by larvae of swift moth Endoclita excrescence (Lepidoptera: Hepialidae) on herbivorous and predaceous arthropods on three willow species, Salix gilgiana, S. eriocarpa and S. serissaefolia. The leaves of sprouting lateral shoots induced by moth-boring had a low C:N ratio. The overall abundance and species richness of herbivorous insects on the lateral shoots were increased on all three willow species. Densities of specialist chewers and sap-feeders, and leaf miners increased on the newly emerged lateral shoots. In contrast, the densities of generalist chewers and sap-feeders, and gall makers did not increase. Furthermore, ant and spider densities, and the overall abundance and species richness of predaceous arthropods increased on the lateral shoots on S. gilgiana and S. eriocarpa, but not S. serissaefolia. In addition to finding that effects of moth-boring on arthropod abundance and species richness varied among willow species, we also found that moth-boring, willow species, and their interaction differentially affected community composition. Our findings suggest that moth-boring has community-wide impacts on arthropod assemblages across three trophic levels via induced shoot regrowth and increase arthropod species diversity in this three willow species system. {\textcopyright} 2009 Oikos.},

abstract = {Several recent studies have emphasised that community composition alters species trait evolution. Here, we demonstrate that differences in composition of local herbivore communities lead to divergent trait evolution of the leaf beetle Plagiodera versicolora through plant-mediated indirect interactions. Our field surveys, genetic analyses and community-manipulation experiments show that herbivore community composition determines the degree of herbivore-induced regrowth of willows (Salicaceae), which in turn, promotes the divergent evolution of feeding preference in the leaf beetle from exclusive preference for new leaves to a lack of preference among leaf-age types. Regrowth intensity depends both on the differential response of willows to different herbivore species and the integration of those herbivore species in the community. Because herbivore-induced regrowth involves phenological changes in new leaf production, leaf beetle populations develop divergent feeding preferences according to local regrowth intensity. Therefore, herbivore community composition shapes the selection regime for leaf beetle evolution through trait-mediated indirect interactions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {The observation that species may be positively or negatively associated with each other is at least as old as the debate surrounding the nature of community structure which began in the early 1900's with Gleason and Clements. Since then investigating species co-occurrence patterns has taken a central role in understanding the causes and consequences of evolution, history, coexistence mechanisms, competition, and environment for community structure and assembly. This is because co-occurrence among species is a measurable metric in community datasets that, in the context of phylogeny, geography, traits, and environment, can sometimes indicate the degree of competition, displacement, and phylogenetic repulsion as weighed against biotic and environmental effects promoting correlated species distributions. Historically, a multitude of different co-occurrence metrics have been developed and most have depended on data randomization procedures to produce null distributions for significance testing. Here we improve upon and present an R implementation of a recently published model that is metric-free, distribution-free, and randomization-free. The R package, cooccur, is highly accessible, easily integrates into common analyses, and handles large datasets with high performance. In the article we develop the package's functionality and demonstrate aspects of co-occurrence analysis using three sample datasets.},

abstract = {Genetic variation in individual species can have important ecological consequences, and sometimes, these interactions are mediated through another species. For example, genetic variation in an herbivore could alter plant responses that then influence other plant-associated arthropods. However, few systems have experimentally tested the ecological consequences of genetic variation as mediated through other species, especially within the same trophic community context. I studied how evolution of feeding preference in the willow leaf beetle (Plagiodera versicolora), which occurs under selection in a herbivore community context, feeds back to an arthropod community through plant-mediated indirect interactions. Previous studies show beetle populations locally adapt distinct preferences ranging from the gourmet-type, which feeds exclusively on new leaves of willows, to the no-preference (no-pref) type, which displays non-preferential feeding on leaves of different ages. I conducted field experiments at two sites that mimicked evolutionary changes in the feeding preference of the leaf beetle. I manipulated the composition of leaf beetle feeding types for 6 days in spring and then investigated subsequent development of arthropod communities. I found that initial herbivory by a higher proportion of gourmet-type beetles led to lower subsequent abundance of conspecific beetle larvae. In contrast, a higher proportion of gourmet-type beetles resulted in higher abundance of aphids. Aphid-tending ants also increased with the increasing abundance of aphids. As a result, species diversity of arthropod communities decreased with the proportion of gourmet-type beetles in the initial beetle treatment. Community assembly dynamics were significantly influenced by interactive effects between the initial beetle treatment and subsequent colonizer species identities. Thus, beetle genetic variation had long-lasting effects through a temporal chain of indirect interactions likely mediated through induced plant responses and the abundance of aphids. Synthesis. Evolutionary changes in feeding traits within an herbivore species had profound but predictable impact on local arthropod communities. Because the feeding evolution of herbivores nearly always occurs in a community context, plant-mediated feedback loops between the evolution and ecological community of arthropods may be widespread in nature.

abstract = {The analysis of species co-occurrence patterns continues to be a main pursuit of ecologists, primarily because the coexistence of species is fundamentally important in evaluating various theories, principles and concepts. Examples include community assembly, equilibrium versus non-equilibrium organization of communities, resource partitioning and ecological character displacement, the local-regional species diversity relationship, and the metacommunity concept. Traditionally, co-occurrence has been measured and tested at the level of an entire species presence-absence matrix wherein various algorithms are used to randomize matrices and produce statistical null distributions of metrics that quantify structure in the matrix. This approach implicitly recognizes a presence-absence matrix as having some real ecological identity (e.g. a set of species exhibiting nestedness among a set of islands) in addition to being a unit of statistical analysis. An emerging alternative is to test for non-random co-occurrence between paired species. The pairwise approach does not analyse matrix-level structure and thus views a species pair as the fundamental unit of co-occurrence. Inferring process from pattern is very difficult in analyses of co-occurrence; however, the pairwise approach may make this task easier by simplifying the analysis and resulting inferences to associations between paired species. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {The way species affect one another in ecological communities often depends on the order of species arrival. The magnitude of such historical contingency, known as priority effects, varies across species and environments, but this variation has proven difficult to predict, presenting a major challenge in understanding species interactions and consequences for community structure and function. Here, we argue that improved predictions can be achieved by decomposing species' niches into three components: overlap, impact and requirement. Based on classic theories of community assembly, three hypotheses that emphasise related, but distinct influences of the niche components are proposed: priority effects are stronger among species with higher resource use overlap; species that impact the environment to a greater extent exert stronger priority effects; and species whose growth rate is more sensitive to changes in the environment experience stronger priority effects. Using nectar-inhabiting microorganisms as a model system, we present evidence that these hypotheses complement the conventional hypothesis that focuses on the role of environmental harshness, and show that niches can be twice as predictive when separated into components. Taken together, our hypotheses provide a basis for developing a general framework within which the magnitude of historical contingency in species interactions can be predicted. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {Microarray technology has given plant biologists the ability to simultaneously monitor changes in the expression of hundreds of genes, and yet, to date, this technology has not been applied to ecological phenomena. In native tobacco (Nicotiana attenuata), prior attack of sap-feeding mirids (Tupiocoris notatus) results in vaccination of the plant against subsequent attacks by chewing hornworms (Manduca sexta). This vaccination is mediated by a combination of direct and indirect defenses and tolerance responses, which act in concert with the attack preferences of a generalist predator. Here, we use microarrays enriched in herbivore-elicited genes with a principal components analysis (PCA) to characterize transcriptional 'imprints' of single, sequential, or simultaneous attacks by these two main herbivores of N. attenuata. The PCA identified distinctly different imprints left by individual attack from the two species after 24 h, but not after 5 days. Moreover, imprints of sequential or simultaneous attacks differed significantly from those of single attack, suggesting the existence of a distinct gene expression program responsive to the combination of biological stressors. A dissection of the transcriptional imprints revealed responses in direct and indirect defense genes that were well correlated with observed increases in defense metabolites. Attack from both herbivores elicits a switch from growth- to defense-related transcriptional processes, and herbivore-specific changes occur largely in primary metabolism and signaling cascades. PCA of these polygenic transcriptional imprints characterizes the ephemeral changes in the transcriptome that occur during the maturation of ecologically relevant phenotypic responses.},

abstract = {Community assembly may not follow predictable successional stages, with a large fraction of the species pool constituted by potential pioneering species and successful founders defined through lottery. In such systems, priority effects may be relevant in the determination of trajectories of developing communities and hence diversity and assemblage structure at later advanced states. In order to assess how different founder species may trigger variable community trajectories and structures, we conducted an experimental study using subtidal sessile assemblages as model. We manipulated the identity of functionally different founders and initial colony size (a proxy of the time lag before the arrival of later species), and followed trajectories. We did not observe any effects of colony size on response variables, suggesting that priority effects take place even when the time lag between the establishment of pioneering species and late colonizers is very short. Late community structure at experimental panels that started either with the colonial ascidian Botrylloides nigrum, or the arborescent bryozoan Bugula neritina, was similar to control panels allowed natural assembling. In spite of high potential for fast space domination, and hence negative priority effects, B. nigrum suffered high mortality and did not persist throughout succession. Bugula neritina provided complex physical microhabitats through conspecific clustering that have enhanced larval settlement of late species arrivals, but no apparent facilitation was observed. Differently, panels founded by the encrusting bryozoan Schizoporella errata led to different and less diverse communities compared to naturally assembled panels, evidencing strong negative priority effects through higher persistence and space preemption. Schizoporella errata founder colonies inhibited further conspecific settlement, which may greatly relax intraspecific competition, allowing resource allocation to colony growth and space domination, thus reducing the chances for the establishment of other species.},

abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate whether presence of levator ani muscle (LAM) avulsion was associated with expulsion of vaginal pessary for women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Methods: This prospective observational study recruited consecutive women with symptomatic POP. Vaginal pessary was offered and offline analysis of the 3D/4D transperineal ultrasound volume data of women was performed. Volume acquisition had been performed before pessary insertion. LAM was assessed on pelvic floor muscle contraction (PFMC) and hiatal dimensions were assessed at rest, PFMC and maximum Valsalva. Results were then compared between women who were able to use vaginal pessary for 1 year and those whose pessary was expulsed within 1 year. Results: The dataset of 255 women were analyzed with 147 (57.6%) of them used vaginal pessary continuously over 1 year and 108 (42.4%) whose pessary was expulsed. Their mean age was 63.2 (SD: 9.9) years and median parity was 3 (2-4). Eighteen (7.1%) had stage I, 164 (64.3%) Stage II, 67 (26.3%) Stage III and 6 (2.4%) Stage IV POP. Women who had vaginal pessary expulsed had significantly larger hiatal dimensions at rest and Valsalva, larger hiatal area during rest, PFMC and Valsalva and also more of them have LAM avulsion (53.7% vs 27.2%, p<0.01). After controlling for potential confounders, LAM avulsion remained a risk factor (OR 3.18, p<0.01) of expulsion of vaginal pessary within 1 year. Conclusions: We showed a larger hiatus in women who expulsed a vaginal pessary. Presence of LAM avulsion increases the risk of expulsion of vaginal pessary within 1 year threefold.},

However, factors determining the extent to which priority effects affect community assembly remain unclear. Using laboratory populations of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens, we examined whether shared evolutionary history affected the strength of priority effects. We hypothesized that sympatric evolution of populations belonging to the same guild would lead to niche differentiation, resulting in phenotypic complementarity that weakens priority effects. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that priority effects tended to be weaker in sympatrically evolved pairs of immigrating populations than in allopatrically evolved pairs. Furthermore, priority effects were weaker under higher phenotypic complementarity. However, these patterns were observed only in populations with a relatively short history of sympatric evolution, and disappeared when populations had evolved together for a long time. Together, our results suggest that the evolutionary history of organismal traits may dictate the strength of priority effects and, consequently, the extent of historical contingency in the assembly of ecological communities.},

abstract = {In the last two decades the subtropical red tomato spider mite, Tetranychus evansi, has expanded its geographical distribution and emerged as a major invasive agricultural pest. The mite is considered to be native to South America. Since its first report from north-eastern Brazil in 1952, it has been reported from different continents. This paper reviews literature on several aspects of the biology of T. evansi related to its status as an invasive species. It addresses taxonomical issues, occurrences, life history traits, host-plant interactions, genetic diversity of geographical isolates and worldwide colonisation pathways. It also presents updated data which allowed the assessment of the actual worldwide distribution of this species, from its discovery to the latest reports. As T. evansi is considered an emerging agricultural pest, we also present data based on modelling of the potential of T. evansi to colonize new geographical areas. In addition, this review presents past and current research on natural enemies of T. evansi potentially useful for its biological control. While summarizing the knowledge on T. evansi, the review emphasizes research possibilities that are worth pursuing, mainly concerning the ability of T. evansi to establish new populations and to detect new promising natural enemies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Following herbivore attack, plants can either reduce damage by inducing defenses or mitigate herbivory eff ects through compen- satory growth and reproduction. It is increasingly recognized that such induced defenses in plants are herbivore-specifi c, but less is known about the specifi city of compensatory responses. Damage by multiple herbivores may also lead to synergistic eff ects on induction and plant fi tness that diff er from those caused by a single herbivore species. Although largely unstudied, the order of arrival and damage by diff erent herbivore species might also play an important role in the impacts of herbivory on plants. METHODS: We investigated the specifi city of defense induction (phenolics) and eff ects on growth (number of stems and leaves) and reproduction (number of seeds, seed mass, and germination rate) from feeding by two generalist leaf-chewing herbivores ( Spodoptera eridania and Diabrotica balteata ) on Phaseolus lunatus plants and evaluated whether simultaneous attack by both herbivores and their order of arrival infl uenced such dynamics. KEY RESULTS: Herbivory increased levels of leaf phenolics, but such eff ects were not herbivore-specifi c. In contrast, herbivory enhanced seed germination in an herbivore-specifi c manner. For all variables measured, the combined eff ects of both herbivore species did not diff er from their individual eff ects. Fi- nally, the order of herbivore arrival did not infl uence defense induction, plant growth, or seed number but did infl uence seed mass and germination. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study highlights novel aspects of the specifi city of plant responses induced by damage from multiple species of herbivores and uniquely associates such eff ects with plant lifetime fi tness.},

abstract = {Lethal time50 (LTime50) and lethal temp (LTemp50) are commonly used laboratory indices of arthropod cold tolerance, with the former often being employed to predict winter survival in the field. In the present study, we compare the cold tolerance of different life-history stages (nondiapausing and diapausing females, as well as males and juveniles) of a major agricultural pest: the two-spot spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acarina: Tetranychidae). Diapausing females from European populations of this species are shown to be freeze avoiding, supercooling to −23.6 ± 0.37 °C and with an LTemp50 of −23.2 °C. However, nondiapausing females [supercooling point (SCP) –19.1 ± 0.49 °C, LTemp50 –14.32 °C], males (SCP –21.27 ± 0.52 °C, LTemp50 –16 °C) and juveniles (SCP –25.34 ± 0.29 °C, LTemp50 –18.3 °C) are subclassified as strongly chill tolerant juveniles. LTime50 is 148.3 days for non-acclimated diapausing females, whereas nondiapausing females, males and juveniles reach 50% mortality by 21.7 days. When individuals are acclimated at 10 °C for a period of 7 days, no effect is found. Cold tolerance is suggested to be a major contributor to the successful spread of T. urticae across temperate countries, although it is dependent on a diapause trait, suggesting a potential target for control. Winter field trial data from diapausing females indicate that LTime50 is a reliable indicator of winter survival even within diapause, supporting the use of these indices as a valuable component within environmental niche models for the prediction of future pest invasions.},

When growth was light limited, tannin concentrations were low, but when growth was nutrient lmited, tannin concentrations were high. Only leaves that expanded to maturity under different environmental conditions differed in their acceptability to leaf-cutter ants. Despite higher concentratins of tannins, leaf-cutter ants preferred leaves of seedlings that were grown at 20% light over leaves of seedlings grown at 2% light, but fertilization increased the acceptability of leaves when seedlings were grown at 20% light, a result consistent with the avoidance of very-high-tannin leaves. -from Author},

abstract = {Although predation has a lethal effect on prey, mature terrestrial plants are rarely killed by herbivores, but herbivory can change plant allelochemistry, cell structure and growth, physiology, morphology, and phenology. This review explores the herbivore-induced indirect effects mediated by such plant responses following herbivory in terrestrial systems. Herbivore-induced indirect effects are ubiquitous in many plant-herbivore systems, and indirect interactions occur among temporally separated, spatially separated, and taxonomically distinct herbivore species. Unlike interspecific competition, herbivores can benefit each other through plant-mediated indirect effects. Herbivore-induced changes in plants occur at low levels of herbivory, which increases the likelihood of plant-mediated indirect interactions between herbivores. The herbivore-induced indirect effects result in interaction linkages, which alter species richness and abundance in arthropod communities. Such interaction linkages should be depicted using indirect interaction webs, which incorporate nontrophic. indirect links. The idea of interaction linkages by herbivore-induced indirect effects that shape community organization and biodiversity is an important revision of the traditional view of plant-based terrestrial food webs.

abstract = {Plant-herbivore interactions evolved over long periods of time, resulting in an elaborate arms race between interacting species. While specialist herbivores evolved specific strategies to cope with the defenses of a limited number of hosts, our understanding of how generalist herbivores deal with the defenses of a plethora of diverse host plants is largely unknown. Understanding the interaction between a plant host and a generalist herbivore requires an understanding of the plant's mechanisms aimed at defending itself and the herbivore's mechanisms intended to counteract diverse defenses. In this review, we use the two-spotted spider mite (TSSM), Tetranychus urticae (Koch) as an example of a generalist herbivore, as this chelicerate pest has a staggering number of plant hosts.We first establish that the ability of TSSM to adapt to marginal hosts underlies its polyphagy and agricultural pest status. We then highlight our understanding of direct plant defenses against spider mite herbivory and review recent advances in uncovering mechanisms of spider mite adaptations to them. Finally, we discuss the adaptation process itself, as it allows TSSM to overcome initially effective plant defenses. A highquality genome sequence and developing genetic tools, coupled with an ease of mite experimental selection to new hosts, make TSSM an outstanding systemto study the evolution of host range, mechanisms of pest xenobiotic resistance and plant-herbivore interactions. In addition, knowledge of plant defense mechanisms that affect mite fitness are of practical importance, as it can lead to development of new control strategies against this important agricultural pest. In parallel, understanding mechanisms of mite counter adaptations to these defenses is required to maintain the efficacy of these control strategies in agricultural practices.},

abstract = {The consequences of global change for the maintenance of species diversity will depend on the sum of each species responses to the environment and on the interactions among them. A wide ecological literature supports that these species-specific responses can arise from factors related to life strategies, evolutionary history and intraspecific variation, and also from environmental variation in space and time. In the light of recent advances from coexistence theory combined with mechanistic explanations of diversity maintenance, we discuss how global change drivers can influence species coexistence. We revise the importance of both competition and facilitation for understanding coexistence in different ecosystems, address the influence of phylogenetic relatedness, functional traits, phenotypic plasticity and intraspecific variability, and discuss lessons learnt from invasion ecology. While most previous studies have focused their efforts on disentangling the mechanisms that maintain the biological diversity in species-rich ecosystems such as tropical forests, grasslands and coral reefs, we argue that much can be learnt from pauci-specific communities where functional variability within each species, together with demographic and stochastic processes becomes key to understand species interactions and eventually community responses to global change.},

abstract = {Modern coexistence theory is increasingly used to explain how differences between competing species lead to coexistence versus competitive exclusion. Although research testing this theory has focused on deterministic cases of competitive exclusion, in which the same species always wins, mounting evidence suggests that competitive exclusion is often historically contingent, such that whichever species happens to arrive first excludes the other. Coexistence theory predicts that historically contingent exclusion, known as priority effects, will occur when large destabilizing differences (positive frequency-dependent growth rates of competitors), combined with small fitness differences (differences in competitors' intrinsic growth rates and sensitivity to competition), create conditions under which neither species can invade an established population of its competitor. Here we extend the empirical application of modern coexistence theory to determine the conditions that promote priority effects. We conducted pairwise invasion tests with four strains of nectar-colonizing yeasts to determine how the destabilizing and fitness differences that drive priority effects are altered by two abiotic factors characterizing the nectar environment: Sugar concentration and pH. We found that higher sugar concentrations increased the likelihood of priority effects by reducing fitness differences between competing species. In contrast, higher pH did not change the likelihood of priority effects, but instead made competition more neutral by bringing both fitness differences and destabilizing differences closer to zero. This study demonstrates how the empirical partitioning of priority effects into fitness and destabilizing components can elucidate the pathways through which environmental conditions shape competitive interactions.},

To this aim, we investigated infections by the most common bacterial reproductive manipulators in herbivorous spider mites of South-Western Europe. Across 16 populations belonging to three Tetranychus species, Wolbachia was the most prevalent (ca. 61%), followed by Cardinium (12%-15%), while only few individuals were infected by Rickettsia (0.9%-3%), and none carried Arsenophonus or Spiroplasma. These endosymbionts are here reported for the first time in Tetranychus evansi and Tetranychus ludeni, and showed variable infection frequencies between and within species, with several cases of coinfections. Moreover, Cardinium was more prevalent in Wolbachia-infected individuals, which suggests facilitation between these symbionts. Finally, sequence comparisons revealed no variation of the Wolbachia wsp and Rickettsia gtlA genes, but some diversity of the Cardinium 16S rRNA, both between and within populations of the three mite species. Some of the Cardinium sequences identified belonged to distantly-related clades, and the lack of association between these sequences and spider mite mitotypes suggests repeated host switching of Cardinium. Overall, our results reveal a complex community of symbionts in this system, opening the path for future studies.},

abstract = {Plants and herbivores are thought to be engaged in a coevolutionary arms race: rising frequencies of plants with anti-herbivore defences exert pressure on herbivores to resist or circumvent these defences and vice versa. Owing to its frequency-dependent character, the arms race hypothesis predicts that herbivores exhibit genetic variation for traits that determine how they deal with the defences of a given host plant phenotype. Here, we show the existence of distinct variation within a single herbivore species, the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, in traits that lead to resistance or susceptibility to jasmonate (JA)-dependent defences of a host plant but also in traits responsible for induction or repression of JA defences. We characterized three distinct lines of T. urticae that differentially induced JA-related defence genes and metabolites while feeding on tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum). These lines were also differently affected by induced JA defences. The first line, which induced JA-dependent tomato defences, was susceptible to those defences; the second line also induced JA defences but was resistant to them; and the third, although susceptible to JA defences, repressed induction. We hypothesize that such intraspecific variation is common among herbivores living in environments with a diversity of plants that impose diverse selection pressure. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Ecological communities characteristically contain a wide diversity of species with important functional, economic and aesthetic value. Ecologists have long questioned how this diversity is maintained. Classic theory shows that stable coexistence requires competitors to differ in their niches; this has motivated numerous investigations of ecological differences presumed to maintain diversity. That niche differences are key to coexistence, however, has recently been challenged by the neutral theory of biodiversity, which explains coexistence with the equivalence of competitors. The ensuing controversy has motivated calls for a better understanding of the collective importance of niche differences for the diversity observed in ecological communities. Here we integrate theory and experimentation to show that niche differences collectively stabilize the dynamics of experimental communities of serpentine annual plants. We used field-parameterized population models to develop a null expectation for community dynamics without the stabilizing effects of niche differences. The population growth rates predicted by this null model varied by several orders of magnitude between species, which is sufficient for rapid competitive exclusion. Moreover, after two generations of community change in the field, Shannon diversity was over 50 per cent greater in communities stabilized by niche differences relative to those exhibiting dynamics predicted by the null model. Finally, in an experiment manipulating speciesg' relative abundances, population growth rates increased when species became rareĝ€"the demographic signature of niche differences. Our work thus provides strong evidence that species differences have a critical role in stabilizing species diversity. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Few studies have tested how plant quality and the presence of competitors interact in determining how herbivores choose between different leaves within a plant. We investigated this in two herbivorous spider mites sharing tomato plants: Tetranychus urticae, which generally induces plant defenses, and Tetranychus evansi, which suppresses them, creating asymmetrical effects on coinfesting competitors. On uninfested plants, both herbivore species preferred young leaves, coinciding with increased mite performance. On plants with heterospecifics, the mites did not prefer leaves on which they had a better performance. In particular, T. urticae avoided leaves infested with T. evansi, which is in agreement with T. urticae being outcompeted by T. evansi. In contrast, T. evansi did not avoid leaves with the other species, but distributed itself evenly over plants infested with heterospecifics. We hypothesize that this behavior of T. evansi may prevent further spread of T. urticae over the shared plant. Our results indicate that leaf age determines within-plant distribution of herbivores only in absence of competitors. Moreover, they show that this distribution depends on the order of arrival of competitors and on their effects on each other, with herbivores showing differences in behavior within the plant as a possible response to the outcome of those interactions.},

abstract = {The sequence of species observed after a relatively large space is opened up is a consequence of the following mechanisms. "Opportunist" species with broad dispersal powers and rapid growth to maturity usually arrive first and occupy empty space. These species cannot invade and grow in the presence of adults of their own or other species. Several alternative mechanisms may then determine which species replace these early occupants. Three models of such mechanisms have been proposed. The first "facilitation" model suggests that the entry and growth of the later species is dependent upon the earlier species "preparing the ground"; only after this can later species colonize. Evidence in support of this model applies mainly to certain primary successions and in heterotrophic succession. A second "tolerance" model suggests that a predictable sequence is produced by the existence of species that have evolved different strategies for exploiting resources. Later species will be those able to tolerate lower levels of resources than earlier ones. Thus they can invade and grow to maturity in the presence of those that preceded them. At present there exists little evidence in support of this model. A third "inhibition" model suggests that all species resist invasions of com- petitors. The first occupants preempt the space and will continue to exclude or inhibit later colonists until the former die or are damaged, thus releasing re- sources. Only then can later colonists reach maturity. A considerable body of evidence exists in support of this model. In the majority of natural communities succession is frequently interrupted by major disturbances, such as fires, storms, insect plagues, etc., starting the process all over again. However, if not interrupted, it eventually reaches a stage in which further change is on a small scale as individuals die and are replaced. The pattern of these changes will depend upon whether individuals are more likely to be replaced by a member of their own or another species. If the former, stability will be assured. However, in terrestrial communities, conditions in the soil in the immediate vicinity of long-lived plants may become modified in such a way that offspring of the same species are much less favored than those of other species. A likely cause is the buildup of host-specific pathogenic soil organisms near a long-lived plant. In this case, the species at each local site keep changing, producing local instability. Whether the average species composition of the whole tract does not change, exhibiting global stability, or whether it keeps changing has not yet been decided for any natural community.},

abstract = {The annual life cycles of Tetranychus urticae populations were studied in four different Japanese pear orchards in Ibaraki Prefecture, central Honshu. Some mites overwintered on weeds in the orchards without entering diapause, and others entered diapause and passed through winter in bark crevices of pear trunks and within the strands of vinyl binding ropes used to bind the branches to a trellis. The seasonal prevalences of mite populations in the four pear orchards were similar, but their abundances varied greatly. Population peaks appeared in July and/or from September to early October. The population peak in July was formed by mites that migrated from ground cover vegetation onto the pear trees in spring. Thereafter, mite densities remained at low levels throughout the summer, and a second peak occurred in autumn. In years in which there was a single population peak in autumn, few or no mites appeared on pear leaves during the period of the preceding spring to summer, suggesting that the autumn mites were immigrants from other places, such as neighboring pear orchards. At 18°C and 10 h of light, the incidence of diapause varied from 15.6 to 67.7% among the four populations. In the field, the proportion of diapausing females reached 50% between mid-September and early October. Although diapausing females had overwintered in the pear bark crevices and vinyl binding ropes, the number of females gradually decreased as the season progressed. This decrease may be because some females came out of diapause in response to occasional warm days in winter and migrated onto the ground cover vegetation and/or died from starvation during subsequent cold and dry periods.},

abstract = {Plants respond to attacks by herbivores with various defences, which are mounted through the activation of different biochemical pathways that are known to interact. Thus, the attack of a plant by one herbivore species may result in changes in the performances of other species on the same plant. It has been suggested that species with comparable feeding modes induce similar plant defences and such herbivores are therefore expected to have a negative effect on each other's performance. We studied two closely related phytophagous mite species with identical feeding modes. Yet, one of the species (Tetranychus urticae) induces tomato plant defences, whereas the other (T. evansi) reduces them. We found that the “inducing” species benefits from the downregulation of defences by the “reducing” species, which, in turn, suffers from the induction of defences by the inducing species. Moreover, the performances of the two mite species on leaves that were previously attacked by both species simultaneously were intermediate between that on leaves previously attacked by each of the mites separately. The activity of proteinase inhibitor, a defensive compound, was not found to be intermediate in leaves attacked by both species simultaneously—it was almost as high as the activity seen in leaves with defences induced by T. urticae. Oviposition rates of T. urticae showed a nonlinear correlation with inhibitor activity, suggesting that it is potentially problematic to use this activity as an indicator of the level of plant defence. Our results show that herbivores with similar feeding modes have opposite effects on plant defence and differentially affect each other's performance on co-infested plants.},

abstract = {A species-addition experiment showed that prairie grasslands have a structured, nonneutral assembly process in which resident spe- cies inhibit, via resource consumption, the establishment and growth of species with similar resource use patterns and in which the success of invaders decreases as diversity increases. In our experiment, species in each of four functional guilds were intro- duced, as seed, into 147 prairie–grassland plots that previously had been established and maintained to have different compositions and diversities. Established species most strongly inhibited intro- duced species from their own functional guild. Introduced species attained lower abundances when functionally similar species were abundant and when established species left lower levels of re- sources unconsumed, which occurred at lower species richness. Residents of the C4 grass functional guild, the dominant guild in nearby native grasslands, reduced the major limiting resource, soil nitrate, to the lowest levels in midsummer and exhibited the greatest inhibitory effect on introduced species. This simple mech- anism of greater competitive inhibition of invaders that are similar to established abundant species could, in theory, explain many of the patterns observed in plant communities. biodiversity},

abstract = {Soil legacies play an important role for the creation of priority effects. However, we still poorly understand to what extent the metabolome found in the soil solution of a plant community is conditioned by its species composition and whether soil chemical legacies affect subsequent species during assembly. To test these hypotheses, we collected soil solutions from forb or grass communities and evaluated how the metabolome of these soil solutions affected the growth, biomass allocation and functional traits of a forb (Dianthus deltoides) and a grass species (Festuca rubra). Results showed that the metabolomes found in the soil solutions of forb and grass communities differed in composition and chemical diversity. While soil chemical legacies did not have any effect on F. rubra, root foraging by D. deltoides decreased when plants received the soil solution from a grass or a forb community. Structural equation modelling showed that reduced soil exploration by D. deltoides arose via either a root growth-dependent pathway (forb metabolome) or a root trait-dependent pathway (grass metabolome). Reduced root foraging was not connected to a decrease in total N uptake. Our findings reveal that soil chemical legacies can create belowground priority effects by affecting root foraging in later arriving plants.},
